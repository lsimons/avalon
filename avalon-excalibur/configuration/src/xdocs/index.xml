      <p>
The Configuration package contains extensions to the Avalon Framework
supporting configuration management.

      <section><title>CascadingConfiguration</title>
        <p>
Provides support for the creation of a base and default parent relationship
between two configuration instances.  This is helpful when you have a default
configuration together with a configuration that contains overriding values.
The level of cascading of configurations is arbitary.  The CascadingConfiguration
implementation impements the classic Configuration interface and delegates
invocations to the base configuration.  If the delegate operation fails, the
implementation will attempt to resolve the invocation against the parent
configuration.  Both base and parent configuration reference can be classic or
cascading enabling the creation of complex configuration graphs.

      <section><title>ConfigurationUtil</title>
        <p>
Provides a static list operation that is helpful in debugging.  The list
operation generates a simple string representation of a configuration.
        </p>
        <p>
Also provides a branch operation to take a Configuration object and rename it but
retain all attributes and children.
        </p>
        <p>
Additionally, provide an method to test the equality of two Configuration objects

      <section><title>ConfigurationMerger</title>
        <p>
Similar to the CascadingConfiguration in that it takes two Configuration's and
makes one. The ConfigurationMerger can take a "layer" and a "base" and merge
the layer with the base. The ConfigurationMerger goes a step farther than the
CascadingConfiguration in that it provides a consistent view of
Configuration.getChildren() based off of meta-attributes that can exist in the
layer.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section><title>ConfigurationSplitter</title>
        <p>
Given a Configuration and a "base", generate the "layer" that when passed to
the ConfigurationMerger will yield the original Configuration.
        </p>

      <section><title>ConfigurationValidator</title>
        <p>
A set of tools to apply various XML schema languages to Configuration objects to verify
their validity.
