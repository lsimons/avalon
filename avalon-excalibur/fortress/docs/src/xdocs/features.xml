    <section><title>Features</title>
      <p>
        Fortress provides a framework for you to easily create your
        own application specific containers.  We strive to make it
        easy for you to do without sacrificing any power.  Fortress
        allows you to focus on the core issues in your system, without
        worrying about the component management getting in your way.
      </p>
      <section><title>Asynchronous Component Management</title>
        <p>
          Most component management functions don't take that long to
          perform, but the time they do take can directly affect how
          many requests your system can process at the same time.  For
          that reason, we use the CommandManager from the Event package
          to manage our components.  By moving all the management
          functions to a limited number of background threads, we are
          able to save you time in the critical processing path.
        </p>
        <p>
          The CommandManager can be extended to your components as well.
          That way, your components can perform management tasks in the
          background as well.  Fortress will likely be your choice of
          containers if you have strict performance constraints.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section><title>Extensible Lifecycle</title>
        <p>
          Fortress has support for an experimental feature that allows
          you to extend your component lifecycle in an application
          specific manner.  If it proves to be a truly useful feature,
          other Avalon containers will adopt it.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section><title>Instrumentation</title>
        <p>
          Fortress is integrated with the Instrumentation package so
          you can get a graphical view of the health of your system
          at runtime.  We integrate sampling points for each of the
          component handlers so that you can see how many component
          instances each handler is responsible for.  Using that
          information, you can tune your container more intelligently.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section><title>Attribute Enabled Meta Information</title>
        <p>
          Instead of using a "roles" file to keep track of the component
          configuration name, and what kind of lifestyle the component
          has, Fortress provides some tools so that you can keep track
          of that information with your java source code.  You have to
          use the ANT tasks that are defined in the Fortress tools jar.
          It collects all the attributes defined as JavaDoc doc tags
          and generates the meta info files which are then read at
          runtime.  It makes it a whole lot easier to manage critical
          aspects like lifestyle and which classes represent components.
