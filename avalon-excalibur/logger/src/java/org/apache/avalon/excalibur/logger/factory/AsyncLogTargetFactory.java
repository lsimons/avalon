/**
 * AsyncLogTargetFactory class.
 *
 * This factory creates LogTargets with a wrapped AsyncLogTarget around it:
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 * &lt;async-target id="target-id" queue-size=".." priority="MIN|NORM|MAX|n"&gt;
 *  &lt;any-target-definition/&gt;
 * &lt;/async-target&gt;
 *
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 *  This factory creates a AsyncLogTarget object with a specified queue-size
 *  attribute (which defaults to what the AsyncLogTarget uses if absent).
 *  The LogTarget to wrap is described in a child element of the configuration (in
 *  the sample above named as &lt;any-target-definition/&gt;).
 *  The Thread of the created AsyncLogTarget will have a priority specified by the
 *  priotity attribute (which defaults to Thread.MIN_PRIORITY). The priority values
 *  corresponds to those defined in the Thread class which are:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <blockquote>
 * MIN=Thread.MIN_PRIORITY<br>
 * NORM=Thread.NORM_PRIORITY<br>
 * MAX=Thread.MAX_PRIORITY<br>
 * number=priority number (see class java.lang.Thread)<br>
