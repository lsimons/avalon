 * PriorityFilterTargetFactory class.

 *  &lt;any-target-definition/&gt;

 *  This factory creates a PriorityFilter object with a logging Priority set
 *  to the value of the log-level attribute (which defaults to INFO if absent).
 *  The LogTarget to filter is described in child elements of the configuration (in
 *  the sample above named as &lt;any-target-definition/&gt;).
