  ---------------------------------

  You can browse the results of our unit testing in the filesystem.  If this is
  a distribution, the results should be in docs/test.  Point your browser at the
  index.html file and browse away.  If you want to generate the tests and run them
  for yourself, you need to check this project out from CVS and the "jakarta-avalon"
  project (which has the libraries to build everything).  After that, you can type
  "./build.sh test" for UNIX or "build test" for Windows.
