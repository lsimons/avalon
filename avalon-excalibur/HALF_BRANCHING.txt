                    =======================================


This file contains a quick guide on how to only branch some files in a CVS
repository, with jakarta-avalon-logkit as an example. These instructions are
Unix-specific. Commands marked (**) are described in the appendix.


  Branching existing files
  ------------------------

Say you just want to branch one file, build.xml. The steps would be:

    cvs tag -b centipede build.xml

This tells CVS to create a branch tag in CVS called 'centipede', on the
file build.xml. 

    cvs update -r centipede build.xml

This means "I want to edit the 'centipede' branch of build.xml". Now if
you modify build.xml and commit, the commit message will say 'Tag: centipede':

CVS: ----------------------------------------------------------------------
CVS: Enter Log.  Lines beginning with `CVS:' are removed automatically
CVS: 
CVS: Committing in .
CVS: 
CVS: Modified Files:
CVS:  Tag: centipede
CVS:    build.xml 
CVS: ----------------------------------------------------------------------


Now imagine you've branched a number of files like this. How are people going
to get the branched files? They can't do 'cvs update -r centipede' in the
project root, or all the non-tagged files will disappear! We need to *only*
update the tagged files. It's easiest to do this by adding a shell script in
the project root:

#!/bin/sh
cvs update -r centipede build.xml <other files..>

and the equivalent .bat file

@echo off
cvs update -r centipede build.xml <other files..>

Then 'chmod +x build.sh ; cvs add centipede.* ; cvs commit centipede.*'.
Now any users who want to try the Centipede doc system can run
'centipede.(sh|bat)' and get the modified files.


  Behind the scenes
  -----------------
  (this is necessary info for the next step)

The CVS/Entries file contains the status of all files in the current directory.
So jakarta-avalon-logkit/CVS/Entries will originally contain:

/KEYS/1.1.1.1/Mon May  6 23:17:39 2002//
/LICENSE/1.1.1.1/Mon May  6 23:17:39 2002//
/README/1.1.1.1/Mon May  6 23:17:39 2002//
/build.bat/1.1.1.1/Mon May  6 23:17:39 2002//
/build.sh/1.1.1.1/Mon May  6 23:17:39 2002//
/build.xml/1.1.1.1/Mon May  6 23:17:39 2002/
D/lib////
D/src////
D/www////

Note the entry for build.xml:

/build.xml/1.1.1.1/Mon May  6 23:17:39 2002/

After doing the 'cvs update -r centipede' command, this line will read:

/build.xml/1.1.1.1/Mon May  6 23:17:39 2002//Tcentipede


  Adding new files to the branch
  ------------------------------

Let's say we want to add a new directory, tools/antipede, to our 'centipede'
branch (in reality, I hope centipede won't need added files, but this is just
an example).

So first we create the new directory:

    mkdir tools
    cd tools

and copy the antipede directory:

    cp -r /home/jeff/java/krysalis-centipede/tools/antipede .

and then clear out all the old CVS directories (I downloaded Centipede from
CVS):

    find . -name "CVS" -exec rm -r {} \;                 # (**)

Now we must add the new directory structure:

    cd ..      # Get back to root
    cvs add `find tools -type d`

You'll see something like this:

Directory /home/cvs/jakarta-avalon-logkit/tools added to the repository
Directory /home/cvs/jakarta-avalon-logkit/tools/antipede added to the repository
Directory /home/cvs/jakarta-avalon-logkit/tools/antipede/bin added to the repository
Directory /home/cvs/jakarta-avalon-logkit/tools/antipede/lib added to the repository
Directory /home/cvs/jakarta-avalon-logkit/tools/antipede/resources added to the repository
Directory /home/cvs/jakarta-avalon-logkit/tools/antipede/resources/stylesheets added to the repository

Now add the new files:

cvs add `find tools -type f -not -path "*/CVS/*"`                # (**)

So far, nothing special has happened. These are standard steps for adding new
files, described in the NEW_PROJECTS.txt file.

Now comes the difference. Usually, now we'd just type 'cvs commit' and commit
the added files. If you do so, you'll see that there is no tag mentioned in the
commit log:

CVS: 
CVS: Added Files:
CVS:    build.dtd build.xtarget tasks.properties 

So abort that commit! (':q!' in vi)

There is no way with just the 'cvs' command to say "These files, which I
haven't yet added, must be added only to the centipede branch".

So we have to emulate what the 'cvs' command would do, if it were smart enough,
by editing the CVS/Entries files directly:

    cd tools
    find . -name "Entries" -exec perl -i -pe 's:/$:/Tcentipede:g' {} \;     # (**)

Then if we commit, we'll see the tag mentioned:

CVS: Added Files:
CVS:  Tag: centipede
CVS:    build.dtd build.xtarget tasks.properties 


So go ahead, and commit the files.

The last step is to update our shell and bat scripts to update the tools
directory. Add the following line to centipede.sh and centipede.bat:

cvs update -r centipede tools


  Checking that it all works
  --------------------------

Now let's test that everything works, and that regular users can easily
retrieve the centipede-tagged files.

First, go back to the CVS head:

cvs update -A

You should see all the tools/antipede files disappearing:

U build.xml
cvs update: warning: tools/antipede/build.dtd is not (any longer) pertinent
cvs update: warning: tools/antipede/build.xtarget is not (any longer) pertinent
cvs update: warning: tools/antipede/tasks.properties is not (any longer) pertinent
...


Now run the centipede.(sh|bat) file. The tools/ files should reappear:

[jeff@kermit jakarta-avalon-logkit]$ ./centipede.sh 
U build.xml
U tools/antipede/build.dtd
U tools/antipede/build.xtarget
U tools/antipede/tasks.properties
U tools/antipede/bin/ant
...


All done!



  Guide to the weirder commands
  -----------------------------

find . -name "CVS" -exec rm -r {} \;

	This means, "find all the files called "CVS", and for each one found, run
	'rm -r <the file found>'.

cvs add `find tools -type f -not -path "*/CVS/*"`

	Means "In the tools directory, find all files which don't have the path
	*/CVS/*", ie all files except those in the CVS directories.


find . -name "Entries" -exec perl -i -pe 's:/$:/Tcentipede:g' {} \;

	Means find all files called "Entries", and for each one, run this perl command".
	The perl command deserves further dissection:

	perl -i -pe 's:/$:/Tcentipede:g' <some file>

		The '-i' means "don't create any backup". If instead you use '-i.old',
		modified files will be backed up with a .old extension.

		Not sure what -pe does, but the 'e' means "here comes an expression".

		's:/$:/Tcentipede:g' is a search and replace. ':' is the delimiter.
		The format is s:<FROM>:<TO>:<FLAGS>:
		where:
			<FROM> is '/$', meaning "the last / at the end of the line"
			<TO> is '/Tcentipede'
			<FLAGS> is 'g', meaning "do this for every line in the file".
