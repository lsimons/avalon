      <warn>
        This package is under development, and the API is not
        guaranteed to be the same when it is ready for release.
        You can find this in the Scratchpad.jar file if you want
        to play with it.  Do not blame us if the next release of
        Excalibur breaks your code if you use this package.
      </warn>
      <p>
        Avalon Excalibur's Thread Pool Management code is still under
        development.  The package is <code>org.apache.avalon.excalibur.thread</code>
        in the Scratchpad jar.  It is functional, using the no resource
        limiting pool implementation in Excalibur's Pool package.  Expect
        the interface to this change before we promote it to Excalibur.
