    <s1 title="Introduction">
      <p>
        This is the Excalibur Event package which includes event queues,
        asynchronous command processing, and the interfaces to support
        event based programming.  Fortress uses this project to manage
        the components and its pools outside of the direct thread of
        execution.  It has been tested, and only a couple of clean up
        things need to be done to make this an officially released
        package.
