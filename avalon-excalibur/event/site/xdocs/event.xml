    <section><title>Why Event Was Created</title>
      <p>
        Event was created out of a desire to express the Staged Event
        Driven Architecture (SEDA) design in an Avalon way.  It has
        grown to be a robust event pipelining library.  We maintained
        the core concepts from the
        <fork href="http://seda.sourceforge.net/">SandStorm</fork>
        server, and cleaned up the API to have Queues operate in a
        more transactional way.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section><title>When To Use Event</title>
      <p>
        Most of the time, your use of the Event package is only to
        interface to other subsystems.  For instance, the
        <link href="command.html">Command Manager</link> uses the
        Event Queues to receive commands from multiple threads
        simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also use Event when you are developing new systems
        that have loosely coupled, disjunct pieces.  One of the core
        benefits of using event pipelines is that we can easily
        reroute the Queues while the system is running, and not lose
        any events.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section><title>Core Concepts</title>
      <p>
        An Event Pipeline has a set of Sources and Sinks.  A Source
        is where you get more events, or the "dequeue" side of an
        event Queue.  A Sink is where you send events on to the next
        stage, or the "enqueue" side of an event Queue.
      </p>
      <section><title>Source</title>
        <p>
          The Source can be blocking or non-blocking.  A blocking
          Source will stop the current thread from processing until
          there are new events to give to it.  A non-blocking Source
          will return an empty set of events immediately if there
          are no more events.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section><title>Sink</title>
        <p>
          The Sink allows you to add events in a variety of ways.
          You can simply add them one at a time, or you can add
          a whole group of events at one time.  The Sink also supports
          a transactional enqueue which means we can push some events
          on to the Sink, but wait to commit or cancel the events
          at a later time.  The Sink will make room for the events,
          but it will not let them pass through until they are officially
          committed.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section><title>Queue</title>
        <p>
          A Queue is merely the union of a Sink and a Source.  A Queue
          will manage the throughput of the events from Sink to Source.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section><title>Signals and Messages</title>
        <p>
          Signals and Messages are special events that provide contextual
          information.  A message will have a string and/or an object
          attached to it.  They are used mainly for reporting purposes,
          or for the begginings of a Messaging Oriented Middleware (MOM)
          implementation.  A Signal is a control event that the Queue,
          and the system react to.
