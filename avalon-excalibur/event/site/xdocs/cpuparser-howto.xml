    <section><title>System Util Design</title>
      <p>
        SystemUtil determines which CPUParser it needs by examining
        the results from <code>System.getProperty( "os.name" )</code>.
        It strips all the whitespace from the name, and appends it
        to the <code>org.apache.excalibur.util.system</code> package.
        For example, if the "os.name" property returns "Windows XP",
        then the full class name needs to be
        <code>org.apache.excalibur.util.system.WindowsXP</code>.
      </p>

    <section><title>Writing a CPUParser</title>
      <p>
        Writing a CPUParser is not hard.  You only need to know
        how to name your implementation, and then write the relevant
        logic.  All CPUParser implementations must be in the
        <code>org.apache.excalibur.util.system</code> package and
        implement the CPUParser interface.  The example below is
        taken from the WindowsXP CPUParser included in this project.
