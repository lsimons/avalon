    <section><title>Setting Up the PoolManager</title>
      <p>
        In order to set up a CommandManager.  For those instructions,
        follow <link href="command-howto.html">the Command "How To"</link>.
        From there, you want to set up the PoolManager using the following
        code:
      </p>
      <source>
        <![CDATA[
// Using the CommandManager in the variable "commandManager"

PoolManager poolManager = new DefaultPoolManager( commandManager );
        ]]>
      </source>
    </section>
    <section><title>Creating Your Pool</title>
      <p>
        The PoolManager is responsible for manufacturing managed pools,
        and for managing their sizes.  All PoolManager managed pools are
        "soft" limiting.  They will continue to grow while they are being
        accessed heavily, but it will shrink during times of inactivity.
        To create your pool, use the following code:
      </p>
      <source>
        <![CDATA[
int initialEntries = 20;
ObjectFactory objectFactory = new MySpecialObjectFactory();

Pool managedPool = poolManager.getManagedPool( objectFactory, initialEntries );
        ]]>
      </source>
      <section><title>Writing an ObjectFactory</title>
        <p>
          Writing an Object Factory is not that difficult.  You just need to
          implement the ObjectFactory interface.  Below is an example
          implementation:
        </p>
          <source>
            <![CDATA[
public class MySpecialObjectFactory implements ObjectFactory
{
    private final Class m_mySpecialClass;

    /** Create default object type */
    public MySpecialObjectFactory()
    {
        this( MySpecialObject.class );
    }

    /** Create generic object type */
    public MySpecialObjectFactory( Class specialClass )
    {
        if ( null == specialClass )
        {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException ("Class cannot be null");
        }

        m_mySpecialClass = specialClass;
    }

    /** Implement the getCreatedClass() method */
    public Class getCreatedClass()
    {
        return m_mySpecialClass;
    }

    /** Create an instance */
    public Object newInstance()
        throws Exception
    {
        return getCreatedClass().newInstance();
    }

    /** Dispose of an instance */
    public void dispose( Object obj )
    {
        // perform permanent cleanup code
    }
}
            ]]>
          </source>
      </section>
      <section><title>Unmanaged Pools</title>
        <p>
          There are two unmanaged pool types in MPool:
          FixedSizePool and BlockingFixedSizePool.  They are
          similar to one another, but differ in how they respond
          to insufficient resources.  The FixedSizePool fails fast,
          and throws an exception.  The BlockingFixedSizePool tries
          to wait for a specified number of milliseconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Fixed Size Pools are not managed because they will only
          have a certain number of pooled objects at any time.  They
          will never grow or shrink.  They are useful for instances
          where the number of elements are known in advanced.  One
          example is a JDBC connection pool because some vendors require
          you to pay per connection licensing fees.
        </p>
      </section>

    <section><title>Using the Pool</title>
      <p>
        Using the pools is quite simple:
      </p>
      <source>
        <![CDATA[
Object pooledResource = managedPool.acquire();

// do whatever I want with the pooled resource

managedPool.release( pooledResource );
        ]]>
      </source>
      <p>
        What if we have an object that needs to perform some simple
        cleanup?  Have your Object implement the <code>Resettable</code>
        interface.  What if we are migrating from the old Pool package?
        You don't have to do anything.  MPool knows about the old Pool
        package, and will check for its recyclable method.  It will only
        call the Resettable.reset() method if your object implements both
        interfaces.  Both of these will work:
      </p>
      <source>
        <![CDATA[
import org.apache.excalibur.mpool.Resettable;

public class ResettableObject implements Resettable
{
    // All the methods and stuff for the real object...

    public void reset()
    {
        // perform small cleanup code...
    }
}
        ]]>
      </source>
      <source>
        <![CDATA[
import org.apache.avalon.excalibur.pool.Recyclable;

public class ResettableObject implements Recyclable
{
    // All the methods and stuff for the real object...

    public void recycle()
    {
        // perform small cleanup code...
    }
}
        ]]>
