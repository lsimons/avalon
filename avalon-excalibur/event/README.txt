                  Avalons Excalibur Event
                  -----------------------

This is the Excalibur Event package which includes event queues,
asynchronous command processing, and the interfaces to support
event based programming.  Fortress uses this project to manage
the components and its pools outside of the direct thread of
execution.  It has been tested, and only a couple of clean up
things need to be done to make this an officially released
package.
