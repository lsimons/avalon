                  Avalons Excalibur Event
                  -----------------------

This is the Excalibur Event package which Berin needs to 
document.

Getting Started:
----------------

If you downloaded a source release of the component then you
will need to build the component. Directions for building the
component are located in BUILDING.txt

If you downloaded a binary release, or a release with both binary
and source then it is recomended you look over the documentation
in docs/index.html - and then look into the examples/ directory
for examples of the component in action.
