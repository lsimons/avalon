                  Avalons Excalibur Event
                  -----------------------

This is the Excalibur Event package which includes event queues,
asynchronous command processing, and the interfaces to support
event based programming.  Fortress uses this project to manage
the components and its pools outside of the direct thread of
execution.  It has been tested, and only a couple of clean up
things need to be done to make this an officially released
package.

Getting Started:
----------------

If you downloaded a source release of the component then you
will need to build the component. Directions for building the
component are located in BUILDING.txt

If you downloaded a binary release, or a release with both binary
and source then it is recomended you look over the documentation
in docs/index.html - and then look into the examples/ directory
for examples of the component in action.
