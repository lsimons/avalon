    <s1 title="Introduction">
      <p>
        Avalon Excalibur was created in order to ease development of
        new projects.  To that end, Excalibur contains a number of
        ready to use components and utilities that handle everything
        from command line parsing to thread concurrency management.
      </p>
      <p>
        The components in the Excalibur package have been well tested
        and do work reliably.  There is an associated project called
        "Scratchpad" that is a staging area for new Components.  When
        they have been sufficiently tested, we will include them in
        Excalibur.
      </p>
      <warn>
        The scratchpad code is provided for your benefit so that we
        can get feedback on whether the package is needed or wanted,
        and we can get error reports on it.  The components in
        Scratchpad are of varying quality or stability, depending on
        where they are in the development cycle.  They are <strong>NOT</strong>
        meant for production use.  You have been warned.

          This is simpler, though controvercial, alternative to RMI.
