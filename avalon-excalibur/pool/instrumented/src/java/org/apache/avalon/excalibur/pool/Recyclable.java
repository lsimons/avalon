/**
 * This interface standardizes the behaviour of a recyclable object.
 * A recyclable object is defined as an object that can be used to
 * encapsulate another object without being altered by its content.
 * Therefore, a recyclable object may be recycled and reused many times.
 *
 * This is helpful in cases where recyclable objects are continously
 * created and destroyed, causing a much greater amount of garbage to
 * be collected by the JVM garbage collector. By making it recyclable,
 * it is possible to reduce the GC execution time, thus incrementing the
 * overall performance of a process and decrementing the chance of
 * memory overflow.
 *
 * Every implementation must provide their own method to allow this
 * recyclable object to be reused by setting its content.
