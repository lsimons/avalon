/**
 * An Appliance is the basic tool merlin wraps around a component to
 * provide support for lifecycle and lifestyle management. Different
 * implementations of Appliance can be plugged into the merlin system
 * to allow merlin to manage a variety of components.
 *
 * The name appliance is used to call up an association with a kitchen
 * utility like a microwave. Merlin acts as a chef in his kitchen, and uses
 * various appliances to "cook up" various components as the restaurant
 * customers (which can be other components or systems on the other end
 * on the planet) ask for them.
 *
 * An appliance manages the establishment of a component
 * type relative to a deployment criteria. Once established, an appliance
 * provides support for the deployment of component instances on request.
 * An appliance is responsible for component lifestyle and lifecycle
 * management during the deployment and decommission cycles.
