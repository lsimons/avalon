    <section name="About Avalon Utilities">
      <p>
Welcome to the Avalon Utilities Home Page. 
      </p>
      <p>
Within Avalon there are a number of emerging container facilities and tools.
The facilties provide the famework for the delivery of open and adaptive 
solutions to container construction and component mangement.  In the 
development of these facilities, a number of common low-level utilities 
have evolved and are collected here.  Typically these utilities are either
a single class, or a very small number of classes dealing with a specific
concern.  The following table provides a brief overview of the current set.
