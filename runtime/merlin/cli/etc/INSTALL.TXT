Installing Merlin.
------------------

To use Merlin command line support or the Merlin NT Service
you will need to define the MERLIN_HOME environment
variable for your system and include MERLIN_HOME/bin in
your system path.  The MERLIN_HOME environment variable
should point to the merlin directory.

Under Windows you can set environment variables by selecting the 
Environment Tab from the System Control Panel.

Under Linux you can do this as follows:

  $ echo '
  > # set location of merlin
  > export MERLIN_HOME=/opt/merlin
  > # include it in the path
  > export PATH=$PATH:$MERLIN_HOME/bin
  > ' >> ~/.bash_profile
  $ source ~/.bash_profile

Versions of Merlin prior to the 3.2-dev 20031210 build maintained 
a local repository of jar files under the %MERLIN_HOME%/repository
directory.  As of the 20031210 build the repository is maintained 
under AVALON_HOME/repository where AVALON_HOME defaults to 
${user.home}/.avalon.  To override the AVALON_HOME location you can 
either define a AVALON_HOME environment variable or you can add a 
merlin.properties file to ${user.home} containing the 
"merlin.repository" property key and a value point to you preferred 
repository location.

To confirm that your environment variables are correct, you
should open a new command window and invoke the Merlin
CLI application.

  $ merlin -version
