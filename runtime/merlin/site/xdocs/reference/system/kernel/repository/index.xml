     If a resource cannot be located in the local repository 
     cache, Merlin will attempt to locate the resource in one 
     or more remote repositories.  If you have a proxy server 
     you will need to declare it under the proxy element.  If 
     you declare a proxy, the host and port elements must be 
     declared.  You can also declare a 'credentials' element if 
     your proxy requires password authentication.
