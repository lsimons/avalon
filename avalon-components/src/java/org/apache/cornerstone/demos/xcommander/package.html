A rather elaborate demo: a one-to-many socket server which is compatible with the flash 5 xml plugin.

<p>XCommander is a server program which is used to listen for and execute
java commands which are given in xml format
(here's a <a href="doc-files/sample-command.xml">sample command</a>).
It is possible to use XCommander to give any command which can be given
using standard code, using its lightweight xml over TCP/IP protocol.</p>

<p>Internally, XCommander uses a delegating SAX handler together with
the Xerces xml parser (which comes with Avalon) and simple RMI to
convert the xml into Java code.</p>

<p>At the moment, XCommander does not provide security. It simply uses
the current classloader for the block to find classes and execute methods
on them. This means anyone with knowledge of Avalon can wreck the server!
This will be changed: an addRole() and removeRole() option will be added
to the server, and the model Avalon uses for Roles will be implemented.</p>
