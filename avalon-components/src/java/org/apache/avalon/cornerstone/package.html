Avalon Cornerstone is composed of reusable Avalon Blocks (Services)
that are well-tested and scalable. It's purpose is to be a repository
for common Services so that they do not have to be reinvented, thus
speeding up development.<br />
It also contains a few examples of servers built on top of the
Avalon Framework, using the Cornerstone services.
