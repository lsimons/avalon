    <p>
      Phoenix blocks in this package 'masterstore' contain implementations of the Store service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently there are two implementations of the Store service:
      <ul>
        <li>File Object Repository</li>
        <li>File Stream Repository</li>
      </ul>
      TODO: The above two are tied to local file systems to the server.
      Other types envisaged are:
      <ul>
        <li>JDBC</li>
        <li>Remotely Delegate</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
