      <subsection name="Description">
        <p>The threads component provides support for the establishment
        a set of named thread pools.  The component implementation can be configured
        such that multiple thread pools may be defined within which each pool has 
        a minimum and maximum pool criteria and daemon property.  Consumer components
        can access threads from named or default pool using the ThreadManager 
        service interface.</p>

              A demonstration component implementation demonstrates the resolution
              of a ThreadManager and subsequent access to a ThreadPoll against 
              which a Runnable object is launched.  Termination of the container 
              before this time will trigger disposal of the component causing the 
              interuption of the subsidiary thread.
