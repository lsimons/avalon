      Leo initially started work on Avalon because it seemed like
      a place where he could learn a lot about correct software
      architecture. After creating one of the first phoenix applications,
      he set off to work on project documentation, Phoenix and the
      Framework.

      Besides his work within the ASF, Leo develops custom server
      solutions using Avalon and related open source technologies,
      mainly in the fields of Content Management and CRM, as a night
      job. He studies Technical Physics at the University of Twente,
      The Netherlands.
