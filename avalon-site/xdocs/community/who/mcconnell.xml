      Stephen was initially drawn to Avalon in respect to the work
      undertaken in the framework projects.  The consitent and clean
      component-oriented approach seperated Avalon from may other 
      projects.  Stephen, as comitter to Avalon, is involved with 
      framework maintenance and evolution, advanced devopment related 
      to intelligent service management, the Avalon Apps Enterprise 
      project, and the Merlin Service Management Architecture.
