      Hamilton got involved with Avalon in 2003 while re-writing 
      his pet project Polyethylene in a more componentized way. After  
      his addiction he felt the necessity of an Avalon container for 
      CLI (Mono and .Net environments) and has been working on it since then.
      In his TO-DO list there are things like adapt Fortress to Avalon Meta
      package, build a core for a truly distributed container using Jini 
      and make containers in different plataforms to provide services to each other
      through SOAP or IIOP.
