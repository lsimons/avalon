      We've been rather sloppy in maintaining lists of these
      peeps. Many, many people help out with avalon in one way or
      another, be it by providing infrastructure or project resources,
      guidance and advice, patches, or user feedback. You can find
      many names in the avalon mailing list archives and in the
      sources. People, even if we don't keep a list of y'all, thanks
      for all your good work!
