      <p>
      Apache Avalon provides a complete platform for component
      programming including a core framework, utilities, tools,
      components and containers.  By using key design patterns such as
      Inversion of Control (IoC) and Seperation of Concerns (SoC),
      Avalon achieves a number of advantages over traditional object
      oriented programming frameworks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>No implementation lock</li>
	<li>Low coupling between components</li>
	<li>Component lifecycle management</li>
	<li>Configuration management and easy to use API</li>
	<li>Component meta-data framework and tools</li>
	<li>Service dependecy management</li>
	<li>Embeddable containers for standalone, J2EE and web environments</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       In Component Oriented Programming (COP), reusable and
      replaceable components can be assembled in a container to
      provide application blocks.  Blocks in turn can be used to build
      anything from a client desktop application to an FTP server to a
      web service.  Avalon provides a variety of basic components and
      default application blocks in order to help you quickly build
      your own application solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given this, the Avalon team aims to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide a stable COP development platform (currently in
        JAVA)</li>
	<li>Create a rich set of client components API's and default
        implementations</li>
	<li>Develop complete container solutions</li>
	<li>Explore and extend COP development practices</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
       If you're new to Avalon or COP in general, "Welcome!"  You may
       be now wondering where to start.  The following should help you
       find what you're looking for.
      </p>
      <subsection name="Container Users">
       <p>
       Avalon provides a number of containers such as Merlin and
       Fortress.  For information about containers in general, see the
       <a href="product/containers/index.html">containers</a> section.  For other
       Avalon-based or Avalon-related container solutions, see the <a
       href="related/index.html">related projects</a> section.  Avalon is
       used in several external projects, such as Cocoon, OpenIM, and
       others.

       <p>
       If you're new to Avalon, be certain to check out the <a
       href="doc/index.html">Articles</a> section, specifically, the
       <a href="developing/index.html">Developing With Avalon</a>
       white paper and the Getting Started
       Tutorial.  You may also want to look at the Excalibur and
       Cornerstone documentation to examine existing utilities and
       components.

      <subsection name="Avalon Developers">
       <p>
       Whether you're a contributor or a committer, you'll should
       familiarize yourself with the <a
       href="community/process/code-standards.html">Coding Standards</a>
       document.  The <a href="community/index.html">Community</a>
       section also reviews various standards, policies, and practices
       within the Avalon community.
       </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="About Component Oriented Programming">
       <p>
       If you're interested in learning more about component oriented
       programming, then in addition to the <a
       href="doc/index.html">Articles</a> section, look at the
       Framework documentation.  The <a
       href="http://avalon.apache.org/framework/index.html">Framework</a> 
       project contains
       sections of COP practices and is itself a good COP reference
       implementation.

       Wiki</a> site.  The <a href="mailing-lists.html">mailing
       lists</a> are also an excellent resource for support and more
       information.
