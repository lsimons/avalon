              <p>The framework collection includes a component meta model 
              used to describe component dependencies towards a container, and,
              the classic framework APIs that describe the runtime contact 
              between a container and a component.</p>

                A container is a platform supporting the management of 
                components. This page tries to explain how component
                management is done in Avalon.

                In March 2004, Avalon community decided to focus on a single
                reference container, which is 
                <a href="../merlin/index.html">Merlin</a>, but this page
                also give some history on how we arrived where we are.
