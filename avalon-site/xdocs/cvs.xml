	<p>If you are looking to download the source code for stable versions of the Avalon
	projects, you're in the wrong place. You should download a source release from
    <a href="http://avalon.apache.org/srcdownload.cgi">the source download page</a>.</p>

<section name="About CVS">
	<p>CVS, the Concurrent Versions System is a revision control system useful for
	management of source code, and is the predominant version control system used at
	Apache. See <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">The CVS Homepage</a> for
	more about CVS.</p>

<section name="CVS data">
	<p>If you know what you're doing, all you need to know:</p>

<section name="Getting the sources from CVS under Windows">
	<p>There's a few options for you:</p>
	
	<subsection name="Use cygwin">
		
		<p><a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> is a free software suite
		of ports of popular Linux tools and utilities to run natively under windows.
		Among it is a port of the cvs application. If you use cygwin, follow the Linux
		instructions.</p>
	</subsection>
	<subsection name="Use the command-line tools">
		
		<p>The CVS utilities are available as native Windows binaries. Get them from
		<a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">the CVS homepage</a>. To use these
		tools, open a command window (click Start > Run..., then type 'cmd'), then
		enter the following commands:</p>
		
		<source>
rem you can use any directory in place of C:\cvs
rem replace $CVSUTILS with where you installed the cvs binary, or with
rem nothing if you added the utility to your PATH
mkdir C:\cvs
cd C:\cvs
$CVSUTILS\cvs.exe -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org login
rem enter anoncvs when prompted for a password, then hit enter
rem the below command should be on one line
$CVSUTILS\cvs.exe -z3 -d ^
      :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic checkout ^
      avalon avalon-excalibur avalon-components ^
      avalon-phoenix avalon-logkit avalon-site ^
      avalon-sandbox xml-forrest ^
		</source>
		
		<p>This will take a while, depending on your connection. Go ahead and grab
		yourself a coffee or ten. When done, you should have checked out all Avalon
		sources and the most important utility libraries you need to build it (save
            for <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Apache Maven</a>, which you should
            go install right now if you haven't already). For further building instructions 
            run:</p>
<source>
maven avalon:info              
</source>
	</subsection>
	<subsection name="Use TortoiseCVS">
		
		<p><a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/">TortoiseCVS</a> is a neat extension
		for the Windows Explorer which integrates CVS. Using it is real simple:</p>
		
		<p>After you've created a folder where you want to check out the sources to,
		right-click and select CVS Checkout...:<br/>
		<img src="images/tortoisecvs-checkout.jpg" alt="screenshot of CVS settings"/></p>
		
		<p>Then, fill out the settings like in the screenshot below, and then click ok.<br/>
		<img src="images/tortoisecvs-settings.jpg" alt="screenshot of CVS settings"/></p>
		
		<p>This checks out the avalon CVS module. Repeat this procedure for all
		the modules you wish to check out. See above under "CVS data" for the list of Avalon modules, or use the
		<a href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/">ViewCVS Webpage</a> for a full
		list of ASF-hosted CVS modules.</p> 
	</subsection>
	<subsection name="Use WinCVS">
		
		<p><a href="http://www.wincvs.org/">WinCVS</a> is a standalone windows
		application for working with CVS. It has more features than TortoiseCVS, and
		hence more buttons a novice is not likely to use.</p>
		
		<p>After you've created a folder where you want to check out the sources to,
		select the Checkout module... option from the Create menu:<br/>
		<img src="images/wincvs-checkout.jpg" alt="screenshot of CVS settings"/></p>
		
		<p>Then, select the "general tab" and fill out the settings like in the
		screenshot below:<br/>
		<img src="images/wincvs-preferences.jpg" alt="screenshot of CVS settings"/>.</p>
		
		<p>Now, switch back to the first tab and fill out the settings like in the
		screenshot below, and then click ok.<br/>
		<img src="images/wincvs-checkout.jpg" alt="screenshot of CVS settings"/>.</p>
		
		<p>This checks out the avalon CVS module. Repeat this procedure for all
		the modules you wish to check out. See above under "CVS data" for the list of Avalon modules, or use the
		<a href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/">ViewCVS webpage</a> for a full
		list of ASF-hosted CVS modules.</p>

<section name="Getting the sources from CVS under Linux">
	
	<subsection name="Use the command-line tools">
		
		<p>The CVS utilities are available as native linux binaries. Chances are
		you already have them installed. Try it by opening a console and typing 'cvs'.
		If you get an error along the lines of "bash: cvs: command not found", then
		you need to install them first. Under Debian, you can do so by opening a console
		window and entering the commands:</p>
		
		<source>
su -
# enter the root password when prompted
apt-get update
apt-get install cvs
exit
		</source>
		
		<p>Under Red Hat, the commands are a little different:</p>
		
		<source>
su -
# enter the root password when prompted
rpm -i ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/8.0/en/os/i386/RedHat/RPMS/cvs-1.11.2-5.i386.rpm
exit
		</source>

		<p>The procedure is similar for other Linux distributions. Once you have
		these tools installed, open a command window, then enter the following
		commands:</p>
		
		<source>
# you can use any directory in place of ~/cvs
mkdir ~/cvs
cd ~/cvs
cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org login
# enter anoncvs when prompted for a password, then hit enter
cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic \
      checkout avalon \
      avalon-excalibur avalon-cornerstone \
      avalon-phoenix avalon-logkit avalon-site \
      avalon-sandbox jakarta-site xml-forrest
		</source>
		
		<p>This will take a while, depending on your connection. Go ahead and grab
		yourself a coffee or ten. When done, you should have checked out all avalon
		sources and the most important utility libraries you need to build it (save
		for <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a>, which you should
		go install right now if you haven't already).</p>
	</subsection>
	
	<subsection name="Using Cervisia">
		
		<p>KDE's Konqueror browser has CVS support built-in. I've never used it so I
		can't comment on it. See
		<a href="http://cervisia.sourceforge.net/">the Cervisia website</a> for
		more information.</p>

<section name="Platform-independent: jCVS">
	
	<p><a href="http://www.jcvs.org/">jCVS</a> is a 100% java CVS package that I've
	never used.</p>
</section>
<section name="Using an IDE for CVS access">
	
	<p>Most decent IDEs these days provide CVS integration. Apache's Jakarta Project has
  an excellent section on how to configure your IDE: 
	<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/idedevelopers.html">IDE Developer's Guide</a>
  .  It applies equally well to Avalon.
