          <a name="What are lifecycle extensions ?">What are lifecycle extensions ?</a>
        </h3>
      
      
    <p>
      
    Lifecycle extensions are additional stages a component can traverse through during
    it's lifetime. Lifecycle extensions allow a Container to provide extra functionality
    to Components in addition to the standard stages defined by Avalon Framework.
   
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
    Avalon Framework defines a set of standard interfaces often termed as Lifecycle
    metainfo which tells the ComponentManager how a particular Component should be treated
    during it's life.
   
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
    This metainfo allows the developer to separate the various concerns involved when
    writing a Component, often termed SoC and IoC (Separation of Concerns and Inversion of
    Control) and is one of primary advantages of using Avalon.
   
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
    Sometimes it's useful to extend this development paradigm from the framework level
    into the application domain, to create customized lifecycle extensions that are called
    upon in addition to the standard set defined by the Avalon Framework.
   
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
    Such custom lifecycle stages can further enable domain specific logic across many,
    perhaps even unrelated components, can reduce code duplication, and allows the developer
    to reuse the same development and thinking paradigm as the standard lifecycle stages.
   
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
    For example, you might want to pass a specialized SecurityManager to some of your
    components before they are initialized, or have their internal state persistently cached
    during system shutdown and restored at during startup. You might want to pass user
    dependent decryption keys to your component, or give components the opportunity to
    recycle themselves before being disposed or returned to a pooled component handler.
   
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
    The possibilities and number of extensions are only limited by the requirements of your
    particular application domain.
   
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
    This document describes how to add new lifecycle extensions using 
    <strong>
      Fortress
    </strong>
   .
    This document assumes a knowledge of what an Avalon lifecycle is, and a basic understanding
    of the standard lifecycle interfaces Avalon Framework defines. References in this document to
    Component and ComponentManager can also be freely interpreted as Service and ServiceManager
    by the reader.
   
    </p>
   
    <note>
      As at the time of writing, Fortress is the only Avalon container that
    supports lifecycle extensions, which means Components that use this feature will most likely
    only work as expected with Fortress, and not with the other Avalon containers
    (ExcaliburComponentManager, Phoenix, Merlin, Tweety, etc)
    </note>
   
    <p>
      
    Support for lifecycle extensions in the other Avalon containers is technically possible but
    has not yet been discussed. Please check with the Avalon developer mailing list if you use
    one of these containers and would like to use lifecycle extensions.

        <h3>
          <a name="How do I extend a Component&apos;s lifecycle ?">How do I extend a Component's lifecycle ?</a>
        </h3>
      
      
    <p>
      
    Extending a Component's lifecycle is straightforward. An overview of the process
    follows:
   
    </p>
   
    <ol>
      
        
    <li>
      Define the new component interface
    <br>
      
    </br>
   

      Create the new interface defining the operations that should be called upon components
      that implement this interface. Using the previously mentioned examples, this would be
      your 
    <code>
      SecurityManageable
    </code>
   , 
    <code>
      Cacheable
    </code>
   , 
    <code>
      Decryptable
    </code>
   ,
      
    <code>
      Recycleable
    </code>
    interfaces.
      
    </li>
   

     
    <li>
      Define an extension object that calls upon the methods defined in the new interface,
     during one or more of the pre-defined phases of component's lifecycle
    <br>
      
    </br>
   
    
      Create a class that implements 
    <code>
      LifecycleExtension
    </code>
   , that tests any given
      component for the above defined interface (and others if applicable), invoking methods
      defined in that interface.
    
    </li>
   

     
    <li>
      Register the extension object with Fortress' 
    <code>
      LifecycleExtensionManager
    </code>
   
    <br>
      
    </br>
   

      Create an instance of the class defined in the previous step, and register it with a
      
    <code>
      LifecycleExtensionManager
    </code>
   , using either the default manager available inside
      of your container, or an externally created manager that is later given to the container
      to use.
      
    </li>
   

     
    <li>
      Implement the new component interface on your component
    <br>
      
    </br>
   

      Add the new 
    <code>
      implements
    </code>
    clause to your Component, or Component implementation,
      and write any methods defined in the implemented interface.
      
    </li>
   

      
    <li>
      
    <code>
      lookup()/select()/release()
    </code>
    components as normal
    <br>
      
    </br>
   
      Proceed as normal. Checking for extensions is done implicitly within Fortress. Once
      lifecycle extensions are registered they will be invoked on any implementing components
      during the 4 phases defined later in this document.
     
    </li>
   
    
    </ol>
   
    </div>
  
    <div class="h3">
      
      
        <h3>
          <a name="When can a Component&apos;s lifecycle be extended ?">When can a Component's lifecycle be extended ?</a>
        </h3>
      
      
    <p>
      
    The life of any component can be broken down to the following phases:
   
    </p>
   
    <ol>
      
        
    <li>
      Creation
    <br>
      
    </br>
   

      When the Component is actually instantiated.
     
    </li>
   

     
    <li>
      Access
    <br>

      When the Component is accessed via a ComponentManager/Selector
      (
    <code>
      lookup()/select()
    </code>
   ).
     
    </li>
   

     
    <li>
      Release
    <br>
      
    </br>
   

      When the Component is released via a ComponentManager/Selector (
    <code>
      release()
    </code>
   ).
     
    </li>
   

     
    <li>
      Destruction
    <br>
      
    </br>
   

      When the Component is decommissioned, ready for garbage collection.
     
    </li>
   

    
    </ol>
   
    <p>
      A Component will go through it's Creation and Destruction phase only once. Since
    
    <code>
      ComponentHandler
    </code>
    classes can implement different handling strategies
    (Poolable, ThreadSafe, etc), the access and release phases of a component can be
    done multiple times.
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
    Lifecycle extensions can be added to any of the above defined phases. This allows
    you to choose when your particular extension will be executed.
   
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
    For example, thread or user dependent extensions would be added at the access and release
    levels (ie. when the component is retrieved and returned to the ComponentManager) as they
    depend on runtime data not available until they are actually used.
   
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
    More static, or global extensions would be added at the creation or destruction level, since
    they do not depend on any external data that change during runtime, nor are they particular
    to any one context of use.

    This interface specifies the business particular extension components will be tested for.
    It defines the new interface that components will implement to receive additional
    functionality.
   
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
    There is no particular base interface the developer needs to extend, and the interface
    can be kept separate from the Container itself.

        </h4>
      
      
    <p>
      
    Component extensions are invoked via a Lifecycle extension object. Lifecycle extension
    objects are managed via a 
    <code>
      LifecycleExtensionManager
    </code>
    class and essentially
    test for a particular Component extension interface, and appropriately call methods defined
    in that interface.
   
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
    All Lifecycle extension objects must implement the 
    <code>
      LifecycleExtension
    </code>
    interface.
    The 
    <code>
      LifecycleExtension
    </code>
    interface defines 4 methods that are called upon to allow
    an implementor to extend a component's lifecycle.
   
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
    The 4 methods (
    <code>
      create
    </code>
   , 
    <code>
      destroy
    </code>
   , 
    <code>
      access
    </code>
    and
    
    <code>
      release
    </code>
   ) are invoked by a manager class from inside Fortress. Each method
    accepts 2 parameters, the particular Component instance being extended, and the container
    
    <code>
      Context
    </code>
   .
   
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
    The container 
    <code>
      Context
    </code>
    is passed as a parameter to provide access to any
    miscellaneous objects that might be needed during extension code (to make use of this feature
    the container Context will need to be initialized with references and passed to the
    
    <code>
      FortressConfig
    </code>
    during Fortress' startup sequence).
   
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
    Each method may throw an exception to indicate an error, which will be logged, but will
    not terminate other extensions from being executed on that Component.

    Many extensions will not require implementation of every method defined in the
    above interface, for that reason, there's a 
    <code>
      AbstractLifecycleExtension
    </code>
   
    convenience class available which provides default (empty) implementations of each
    method which you can extend from. This allows you to implement only the methods
    necessary for your particular extension.

    <p>
      
    The 
    <code>
      LifecycleExtensionManager
    </code>
    class provides default management of
    extension implementations and an API which ComponentManager/Selector's can call
    upon to execute them.
   
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
    The LifecycleExtensionManager class API is too big to list here, instead please look at
    the following 
    <link href="http://avalon.apache.org/excalibur/fortress/api/org/apache/excalibur/fortress/lifecycle/LifecycleExtensionManager.html">
      link
    </link>
   . It essentially defines
    4 methods for executing extension objects at the various phases of a component's lifecycle,
    and several methods for registering extension objects with the manager.
   
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
    The 
    <code>
      LifecycleExtensionManager
    </code>
    class will operate safely in multithreaded
    environments, and allows you to add/remove extensions to a running system.
   
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
    By default, all Fortress based containers will be initialized with a default
    
    <code>
      LifecycleExtensionManager
    </code>
    that contains no extensions. You can alternatively
    provide a pre-configured LifecycleExtensionManager to your Container via the
    FortressConfig class (
    <code>
      ContainerConstants.EXTENSION_MANAGER
    </code>
    key) if you like.
   
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
    To add a new lifecycle extension object to the manager simply call the method
    
    <code>
      LifecycleExtensionManager.addExtension()
    </code>
   . Methods also exist for removing
    and iterating through the currently available extensions.

    Fortress' inbuilt Component Manager/Selector/Factory code will automatically call
    upon the LifecycleExtensionManager class at each phase in a Component's life at the
    following predefined times:

    <li>
      Access
    <br>
      
    </br>
   

      Called inside the ComponentManager, after the component has been retrieved
      from it's handler, but before it's returned to the invoker of
      
    <code>
      lookup()/select()
    </code>
   .
     
    </li>
   

     
    <li>
      Release
    <br>
      
    </br>
   

      Called inside the ComponentManager, before the component is passed back to
      it's handler to be disposed/pooled/etc.
     
    </li>
   

     
    <li>
      Creation
    <br>
      
    </br>
   

      Called inside the ComponentFactory, before

   .

    <li>
      Destruction

   .
     
    </li>
   
    
    </ol>
   
    <note>
      , components created via Fortress' ComponentHandler classes directly
    will bypass the logic for 
    <code>
      access
    </code>
    and 
    <code>
      release
    </code>
    extensions. This is
    because the code performing this logic is located in the ComponentManager/Selector classes
    (independent from all handlers).

    Let's look at a simple example. The following is also available as a working sample
    in Fortress' examples directory.
   
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
    Our example implements a Lifecycle extension for passing a 
    <code>
      SecurityManager
    </code>
    to
    Components. We'll call it the 
    <code>
      SecurityManageable
    </code>
    interface.
   
    </p>
   
    <div class="h4">
      
      
        <h4>
          <a name="Define the component extension interface">Define the component extension interface</a>
        </h4>
      
      
    <p>
      
    First we define the new Component extension interface.
   
    </p>
   
    <div id="source">
      <pre>
   /**
    * Simple custom lifecycle extension interface for supplying a component
    * with a security manager.
    */
   public interface SecurityManageable
   {
       /**
        * Pass a SecurityManager object to the component
        *
        * @param manager a SecurityManager value
        */
       void secure( SecurityManager manager )
           throws SecurityException;
   }
   </pre>
    </div>
  
    </div>
  
    <div class="h4">
      
      
        <h4>
          <a name="Create the lifecycle extensions class">Create the lifecycle extensions class</a>
        </h4>
      
      
    <p>
      
    Next we define the actual extension implementation which invokes the 
    <code>
      secure()
    </code>
   
    method. We extend from 
    <code>
      AbstractLifecycleExtension
    </code>
    since we only want
    
    <code>
      secure()
    </code>
    to be invoked upon each access (ie. lookup()) to the component, and
    don't need to implement the other 3 LifecycleExtension methods (create, release, and
    destroy).
   
    </p>
   
    <div id="source">

        * @exception Exception if an error occurs
        */
       public void access( Object component, Context context )
           throws Exception
       {
           if ( component instanceof SecurityManageable )
           {
               // pass in a simple security manager, a real system might want to pass
               // in specialized/custom security managers
               ( ( SecurityManageable ) component ).secure( new SecurityManager() );
           }
       }
   }
   </pre>
    </div>
  
    </div>
  
    <p>
      An extension class may run components through any given number of
    extensions, and are not limited to just one.
    </p>
   
    </div>
  
    <div class="h3">

        </h3>
      
      
    <p>
      
    We then inform our container about the extension. This could be done in several different
    ways, for simplicity we'll extend 
    <code>
      initialize()
    </code>
    and add it to the
    
    <code>
      LifecycleExtensionManager
    </code>
    there.

    <p>
      
    (an alternative might be to initialize a LifecycleExtensionManager before creating the
    container and pass it in via the 
    <code>
      FortressConfig.setExtensionManager()
    </code>
    method,
    or to create a LifecycleExtensionManager subclass that includes the extension preset)
