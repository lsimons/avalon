        We forked the portion of his SandStorm server that had to do with
        event processing.  From there we cleaned up the API and made it as

        Excalibur Instrument is an instrumentation utility that allows you
        to attach a separate JVM to your running application to determine its
        health.  Instrumentation is the process of exposing the internal state
        in a way that is easy for an administrator or help desk personell to
        digest.  Excalibur Instrumentation is such a package that you can use
        for your Avalon based projects.

        specifying a 'logger' attribute which denotes the log category
        to use for a particular component (given the
        component is 
    <code>
      LogEnabled

    <code>
      Loggable

        Avalon Excalibur's resource management code allows you to
        be notified when a resource has changed.  There are two
        methods of resource management: active and passive.  Passive
        resource management acts as a holder for resources, and after
        the resource has been modified through it's normal API,
        notification goes to all listeners.  Active resource management
        does the same, but it also polls the resources periodically
        to see if the resource was modified through an external method.
        Active resource management is perfect for monitoring files
        because they can be modified by external programs, and your
        program will be notified when the change occurs instead of
        constantly polling it.

    <code>
      org.apache.avalon.excalibur.pool

    package.
    There are many implementations that are ThreadSafe, and
    one that is not.  You have the option of not limiting
    used resources at all, or limiting the used resources
    based on specific rules.

        A very common problem is resolving a source, which means
        finding a source using a URI.
      
    </p>
   
      
    <p>
      
        The source resolver of Avalon Excalibur is a component
        helping you in this task. It resolves sources from a given
        URI. The URI can use all available protocols of the JRE.
        In addition own protocols can be plugged-in. So using
        the standard protocols like HTTP, FTP or file can be handled
        in the same way, like dealing with custom, self-build
        protocols such as myxmldatabase://root/documents/test.xml.

          The Store Package provides a way to store named objects without 
          taking care about where and how they are stored.
          You can choose between different implementations that store
          the data e.g. in memory or on the file system etc.

              Excalibur's XML Utilities provide simplified wrappers
              for XML parsers, transformers and XPath evaluators. It
              also provides interfaces and classes useful for
              constructing a pipeline of XML components by defining interfaces
              for consuming and producing XML in either SAX or DOM formats.

Avalon is minimizing the number of projects and utilities it maintains
because we need to focus on our charter.  However, we do have users
who have used some of the projects that were previously released.  We
can't just ignore their needs.  The compatibility project is the
graveyard for projects we are no longer supporting.  It exists simply
to let our users (and in some cases, our users' users) continue to
use their legacy components until they migrate to better supported
libraries.

              Due to a number of issues in ECM, not the least of which is a
              simplistic and convoluted design, it has been deprecated in
              favor of Fortress or Merlin.  Fortress has been designed with
              ECM users in mind, so it provides a number of goodies to make
              it easier to migrate forward.  This project will be maintained
              for bug fixes only.
