    Avalon Framework is the central piece to the entire Avalon project.  If you
    understand the contracts and constructs defined in the framework, you can
    understand anything that uses it.  Remember the principles and patterns we
    have already discussed so far.  In this section, we will expound on how the
    Role concept works practically, the lifecycle of components, and how the
    interfaces work.

      In Avalon, all components implements a Service, so we need to define
      the 
    <em>
      Service Interface
    </em>
    and the associated semantic contract.

            Document as much semantic rules (implicit or explicit) as possible.
            This will limit the possibilities of misunderstanding between the
            people who define the 
    <em>
      Service Contract
    </em>
    and the implementing
            developer. Even if that is today the same person, the Service may
            be re-implemented in the future by someone else. Also, additional
            clients shouldn't have to understand the implementation, and 
            everything should be 100% clear from the service documentation.

    <li>
      
              Do one thing and do it well.  A Service should have the simplest
              interface possible, When your service interface extends several 
              other interfaces, you muddy the contract for this Service. An old
              American acronym helps define this pattern: Keep It Simple, Stupid
              (KISS).  It's not hard to outsmart yourself -- We do it all the 
              time.

    <li>
      
              Only specify the methods that are needed in the Service interface. 
              It is important to realize that the Service interface is used
              by client code. Within the component, you probably need additional
              methods between the classes. These methods should be package
              protected and NOT exposed in the Service interface. This increase
              understandability and the possibility to exchange the component
              in the future.

      The entire Avalon Framework can be divided into 5 main categories (as
      is the API): Activity, Service, Configuration, Context, Logger.  Each of 
      those categories represents a unique concern area.  It is common for a
      component to implement several interfaces to identify all the concern
      areas that the component is concerned about.  This will allow the
      component's container to manage each component in a consistent manner.
    
    </p>

        </h4>
      
      
    <p>
      
        When a framework implements several interfaces to separate the concerns
        of the component, there is potential for confusion over the order of
        method calls.  Avalon Framework realizes this, so we developed the
        contract for lifecycle ordering of events.  If your component does not
        implement the associated Interface, then simply skip to the next
        that will be called. The lifecycle order makes it easy to setup and
        prepare the component for use, in each of the lifecycle methods.
      
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
        The Lifecycle of a component is split into three phases:
        Initialization, Active Service, and Destruction.  Because these phases
        are sequential, we will discuss them in that order. 
        The Active Service phase is outside the concern of the container, and
        basically consists of other components calling the methods in the 
        Service interface.
        In addition, the
        act of Construction and Finalization is implicit due to the Java
        language, so they will be skipped.  The steps will list the method
        name, and the required interface.  Within each phase, there will be a
        number of stages identified by method names.  Those stages are executed
        if your component extends the associated interface specified in
        parenthesis.

    <p>
      
          This list of stages occurs in this specific order, and occurs only
          once during the life of the component.

          This group of interfaces refers to contracts for the life cycle of
          the component. Each method allows the generic 
          
    <code>
      java.lang.Exception
    </code>
    to be thrown in any case of error.

    <p>
      
            The 
    <code>
      Disposable
    </code>
    interface is used by any
            component that wants a structured way of knowing it is no longer
            needed.  Once a component is disposed of, it can no longer be used.
            In fact, it should be awaiting garbage collection.  The interface
            only has one method 
    <code>
      dispose
    </code>
    that has no
            parameters.
          
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
            The contract surrounding this interface is that the
            
    <code>
      dispose
    </code>
    method is called once and the method
            is the last one called during the life of the component.  Further
            implications include that the component will no longer be used,
            and all resources held by this component must be released. In a way,
            it is a replacement of 
    <code>
      finalize()
    </code>
   , which has very 
            complicated semantics, that doesn't apply to 
    <code>
      dispose()
    </code>
   .

            The 
    <code>
      Initializable
    </code>
    interface is used by any
            component that needs to perform initializations that take information
            from other initialization steps.  It is more natural to place all
            the initialization in the 
    <code>
      intialize()
    </code>
    method, and only
            gather the required pieces in the preceeding lifecycle methods.
            The interface only has one method
            
    <code>
      initialize
    </code>
    that has no parameters.
          
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
            The contract surrounding this interface is that the
            
    <code>
      initialize
    </code>
    method is called once and the
            method is the last one called during the initialization sequence.
            Further implications include that the component is now live, and it
            can be used by other components in the system.

            The 
    <code>
      Startable
    </code>
    interface is used by any
            component that is constantly running for the duration of its life.
            The interface defines two methods: 
    <code>
      start
    </code>
    and
            
    <code>
      stop
    </code>
   .  Neither method has any parameters.
          
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
            The contract surrounding this interface is that the
            
    <code>
      start
    </code>
    method is called once after the
            component is fully initialized, and the 
    <code>
      stop
    </code>
   
            method is called once before the component is disposed of.  Neither
            method will be called more than once, and 
    <code>
      start
    </code>
   
            will always be called before 
    <code>
      stop
    </code>
   .
            Furthermore, the method must return, it can not go into a endless
            loop. From this follows that the component should create a thread
            and call the 
    <code>
      Thread.start()
    </code>
    method inside this
            method to ctart the continous processing.
            The 
    <code>
      stop()
    </code>
    method should interrupt the thread in a
            safe manner. This should be done by variables and the 
            
    <code>
      Thread.interrupt()
    </code>
    method, slightly depending on how
            the thread is operating.
            Implications of using this interface require that the
            
    <code>
      start
    </code>
    and 
    <code>
      stop
    </code>
    methods be
            conducted safely (unlike the 
    <code>
      Thread.stop
    </code>
   
            method) and not render the system unstable.

          This group of interfaces describes the concern area of configuration.
          If there are any problems, such as required
          
    <code>
      Configuration
    </code>
    elements that are missing, then
          the component may throw a

            Components that modify their exact behavior based on configurations
            must implement this interface to obtain an instance of the
            
    <code>
      Configuration
    </code>
    object.  There is one method
            associated with this interface: 
    <code>
      configure
    </code>
    with
            a 
    <code>
      Configuration
    </code>
    object as the only
            parameter.
          
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
            The contract surrounding this interface is that the
            
    <code>

    method is called once during the
            life of the component.  The

    <p>
      
            The 
    <code>
      Configuration
    </code>
    object is a representation
            of a tree of configuration elements that have attributes.  In a
            way, you can view the configuration object as an overly simplified
            DOM.  There are too many methods to cover in this document, so
            please review the JavaDocs.  You can get the
            
    <code>
      Configuration
    </code>
    object's value as a
            
    <code>
      String
    </code>
   , 
    <code>
      int
    </code>
   ,
            
    <code>
      long
    </code>
   , 
    <code>
      float
    </code>
   , or
            
    <code>
      boolean
    </code>
    -- all with default values.  You
            can do the same for attribute values.  You may also get child
            
    <code>
      Configuration
    </code>
    objects.
          
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
            There is a contract that says that if a
            
    <code>
      Configuration
    </code>
    object has a value that it
            should not have any children, and the corollary is also
            true -- if there are any children, there should be no value.
          
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
            To simplify the code, the method calls 
    <code>
      getChild()
    </code>
   
            and 
    <code>
      getChildren()
    </code>
    will always return Configuration
            and never null.
          
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
            You will notice that you may not get parent
            
    <code>
      Configuration
    </code>
    objects.  This is by design.
            To reduce the complexity of the 
    <code>
      Configuration
    </code>
   
            system, containers will most likely pass child configuration
            objects to child components.  The child components should not have
            any access to parent configuration values.  This approach might
            provide a little inconvenience, but the Avalon team opted for
            security by design in every instance where there was a tradeoff.

          The concept of the 
    <code>
      Context
    </code>
    in Avalon arose
          from the need to provide a mechanism to pass simple objects
          (i.e. non-components) from a container to a component.  
          This has since then grown into a very powerful mechanism in
          Avalon Merlin, where you can create your own Context entries,
          as well as extend the Context instance itself with your own
          implementation.
          See the Avalon Merlin documentation for details on how to define
          custom context entries.

    <p>
      
            The 
    <code>
      Context
    </code>
    interface defines only the
            method 
    <code>
      get
    </code>
   .  It has an
            
    <code>
      Object
    </code>
    for a parameter, and it returns an
            object based on that key.  The 
    <code>
      Context
    </code>
    is
            populated by the container, and passed to the child component who
            only has access to 
    <em>
      read
    </em>
    the 
    <code>
      Context

    <p>
      
            There is no set contract with the

            other than it should always be 
    <em>
      read-only

    by
            the child component.  If you extend Avalon's
            
    <code>
      Context
    </code>
   , please respect that contract.  It
            is part of the Inversion of Control pattern as well as security by
            design.  In addition, it is a bad idea to pass a reference to the
            container in the Context for the same reason that the Context
            should be 
    <em>
      read-only

          Every system needs the ability to log events.  Avalon Merlin 
          uses a subsystem called 
    <em>
      Avalon Logging
    </em>
    which is capable
          of logger subsystem plug-ins. Currently, it supports Apache Log4J
          and the original Avalon LogKit. Expect more systems to follow soon.
          Also, it is fairly easy to create a new Avalon Logging Plug-In,
          in case you need to access a custom logging system.
        
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
          Logging is often done by statically addressing some factory method
          in the Logging subsystem. Avalon always tries to apply Inversion
          of Control, which means that the component should not try to 
          figure out how to obtain a Logger instance, it should be given one
          by the container. The container can then be configured with the
          most suitable Logging system for the application, without any 
          changes to the components.

    <p>
      
            Every component that needs a Logger instance implements this
            interface.  The interface has one method named
            
    <code>
      enableLogging
    </code>
    and passes Avalon Framework's

    instance to the component.

            once during the component's lifecycle before any other
            initialization step.

            The 
    <code>
      Logger
    </code>
    interface is used to abstract
            away the differences in logging systems.  It provides only a
            client API, and a fairly simple API that is.

            A component that uses other components (what we call a 
            
    <em>
      Dependency
    </em>
    ) needs to implement this interface. The 
            interface has only one method 
    <code>
      service
    </code>
    with a
            
    <code>
      ServiceManager
    </code>
    passed in as the only
            parameter.
          
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
            The contract surrounding this interface is that the
            
    <code>
      service
    </code>
    is called once and only once during
            the lifetime of this component.
          
    </p>

    <div class="h4">

    <p>
      
            The 
    <code>
      ServiceManager
    </code>
    is passed to the components that
            implements the 
    <code>
      Serviceable
    </code>
    interface in the 
            
    <code>
      service
    </code>
    method. The 
    <code>
      ServiceManager
    </code>
    has
            a single method, 
    <code>
      lookup
    </code>
   , which is used by the 
            component to locate its dependencies. It does this by passing a
            key in the moethod call and the 
    <code>
      ServiceManager
    </code>
    will
            hand back a component reference of the requested 
    <em>
      Service
    </em>
   .
            I.e. The component requests a 
    <em>
      Service
    </em>
   , but doesn't need
            to be concerned about which implementation, and safely cast the
            returned object to the 
    <em>
      Service Interface
    </em>
   .
            The component must declare which dependencies it has, and can
            explicitly also declare the key that will be used in the 
            
    <code>
      lookup
    </code>
    method call. If no key is defined, the 
            
    <em>
      Service Interface
    </em>
    name must be used.
