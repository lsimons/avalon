      No, it's not a typo. The title has a deliberate play on words
   that implies that incorrect strategies can end up in tragedy. While
   the word "tragedy" may be a bit strong, the thought process does
   have a ring of truth to it. In this chapter we attempt to give you
   helpful hints and tips to boost the performance of your code and
   your development team. We will break the discussion into logging
   strategies, development strategies, component strategies, testing
   strategies, and finally some notes on security strategies.

        </h3>
      
      
    <p>
      Logging is a necessary function in any system. The problem
      arises when the logging is not implemented in an efficient
      manner. Before we get into the nuts and bolts of 
    <em>
      how
    </em>
   
      to create an efficient logging implementation, we have to identify
      
    <em>
      what
    </em>
   
      logging efficiency is.
    </p>
   
    <p>
      In the spirit of the Separation of Concerns pattern, there
      are two problem domains to consider: log organization and log
      writing. Log organization is primarily concerned with how the
      log categories are organized, and how the log files are
      organized. Log writing has to do with the mechanics of writing
      log entries.
    </p>
   
    <div class="h4">
      
      
        <h4>
          <a name="Log Organization">Log Organization</a>
        </h4>
      
      
    <p>
      The Avalon framework and team advocate a category based
         approach to organizing loggers as opposed to a class name
         based approach. There is a very good reason for this. First
         is that categorization allows you to put information of like
         kind in one location. Second, it allows you to turn on and
         off an entire category of log messages.
    </p>
   
    <p>
      The arguments for the class name based logging usually
         fall under these assumptions:
    </p>
   
    <ol>
      
            
    <li>
      
               
    <p>
      There is an implicit match between a class and a category.
    </p>
   
            
    </li>
   

            
    <li>
      
               
    <p>
      It makes it easier to get debug information from a
            specific class if we are having problems with it.
    </p>
   
            
    </li>
   

            
    <li>
      
               
    <p>
      The configuration file can handle the actual mapping
            of classname to log file.
    </p>
    
    </li>
   
        
    </ol>
   
    <p>
      While these arguments have their point, so does a strict
         category based logging approach:
    </p>
   
    <ol>
      
            
    <li>
      
               
    <p>
      You can narrow your log messages farther than simple
            class granularity. This way you can get information from
            the part of the class that really needs it.
    </p>
    
    </li>
   

            
    <li>
      
               
    <p>
      More often than not, a group of classes make up a
            Component. In most cases, the Component is what you are
            really interested in--not the individual classes.
    </p>
   
            
    </li>
   

            
    <li>
      
               
    <p>
      It is easier to manage a configuration file with
            only a few categories that are bound to Component
            instances during runtime you can separate the log files by
            who is concerned with their contents.
    </p>
    
    </li>
   
          
    </ol>
   
    </div>
  
    <div class="h4">
      
      
        <h4>
          <a name="Log Category Organization">Log Category Organization</a>
        </h4>
      
      
    <p>
      I would argue that it is a mistake to use only one
         category for all logging. The reason is that you will
         inevitably need to turn on and off a whole class of
         messages. Another reason is that you will need at least one
         category for each log file you have. One effective approach
         is to separate your logging needs into roles and
         classifications.
    </p>
   
    <p>
      If you have already decomposed your system into
         Components, then you have one set of categories defined. I
         would use a shorthand name for the category names for simple
         reference (e.g. "resource" instead of
         "org.apache.avalon.excalibur.resource.ResourceManager"). The
         simplified names can be used for a broad set of
         classes. Using the same example, the name "resource" implies
         the Resource class, its manager, and anything that is
         directly associated with the concept of a "resource".
    </p>
   
    <p>
      You can also use classifications as a specialization of
         the main role classification. For example, all
         ComponentManager code would have a category name of
         "component". This would allow you to have a Category manager
         for the aforementioned "resource" infrastructure. Typically
         classifications are sub-categories. In this case, the full
         name of the "component" category would be
         "resource.component". This means that we are referring to the
         "component" classification for the "resource" role.
    </p>
   
    <p>
      Most of your logging needs can be organized into this two
      dimensional cross-section of Role and Classification. Roles are
      best for main categories due to their logical
      separation. Typical classifications are "component", "security",
      and "pool". These same classifications can be used as standard
      sub-categories of the different roles. This way your log entries
      can have fine-grained control that is logically organized.
    </p>

        </h4>
      
      
    <p>
      
The mechanics of log writing can vastly affect the
performance of your code. For instance, if you concatenate several
strings together in your log messages, the Java Virtual Machine
converts the concatenation to a StringBuffer, and performs the
expensive 
    <code>
      toString
    </code>
    operation on the result. The

    <code>
      Logger
    </code>
    interface provides a mechanism to optimize away
these conversions when they are not needed.
