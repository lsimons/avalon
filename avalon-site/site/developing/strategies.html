        No, it's not a typo. The title has a deliberate play on words

        the word "tragedy" may be a bit strong, the thought process does
        have a ring of truth to it. In this chapter we attempt to give you
        helpful hints and tips to boost the performance of your code and
        your development team. We will break the discussion into logging
        strategies, development strategies, component strategies and testing
        strategies.

        Logging is a necessary function in any system. The problem
        arises when the logging is not implemented in an efficient
        manner. Before we get into the nuts and bolts of 
    <em>
      how
    </em>
   
        to create an efficient logging implementation, we have to identify
        
    <em>
      what
    </em>
    logging efficiency is.
      
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
        In the spirit of the Separation of Concerns pattern, there
        are two problem domains to consider: log organization and log
        writing. Log organization is primarily concerned with how the
        log categories are organized, and how the log files are
        organized. Log writing has to do with the mechanics of writing
        log entries. Log writing is in turn split into at least two
        concerns, the output target and the formatting.
      
    </p>
   
    <div class="h4">
      
      
        <h4>
          <a name="Log Organization">Log Organization</a>
        </h4>
      
      
    <p>
      
          The Avalon Framework and team advocate a category based
          approach to organizing loggers as opposed to a class name
          based approach. There is a very good reason for this. First
          is that categorization allows you to put information of like
          kind in one location. Second, it allows you to turn on and
          off an entire category of log messages.
        
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
          The arguments for the class name based logging usually
          fall under these assumptions:
        
    </p>
   
    <ol>
      
          
    <li>
      
            There is an implicit match between a class and a category.
          
    </li>
   
          
    <li>
      
            It makes it easier to get debug information from a
            specific class if we are having problems with it.
          
    </li>
   

          
    <li>
      
            The configuration file can handle the actual mapping
            of classname to log file.
          
    </li>
   
        
    </ol>
   
    <p>
      
          While these arguments have their point, so does a strict
          category based logging approach:
        
    </p>
   
    <ol>
      
          
    <li>
      
            You can narrow your log messages farther than simple
            class granularity. This way you can get information from
            the part of the class that really needs it.
          
    </li>
   

          
    <li>
      
            More often than not, a group of classes make up a
            component. In most cases, the component is what you are
            really interested in--not the individual classes.
          
    </li>
   

          
    <li>
      
            It is easier to manage a configuration file with
            only a few categories that are bound to component
            instances during runtime you can separate the log files by
            who is concerned with their contents.
          
    </li>
   
        
    </ol>
   
    <p>
      
          The issue is made more complex by the fact that Log4J has
          a dot-notation hierarchical category system, but is most
          often used for the package/class hierarchy, and not by
          explicit names.
        
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
          Avalon Logging is an interesting approach, where the component
          declares the Loggers it want to have available in the Type
          descriptor, and the container satisfy this need, by mapping
          those categories to the underlying logging system's categories.
          Furthermore, you set the priority for each such category in
          the block.xml, which can be overridden in the config.xml.
        
    </p>
   
    </div>
  
    <div class="h4">
      
      
        <h4>
          <a name="Log Category Organization">Log Category Organization</a>
        </h4>
      
      
    <p>
      
          We argue that it is a mistake to use only one
          category for all logging. The reason is that you will
          inevitably need to turn on and off a whole class of
          messages. Another reason is that you will need at least one
          category for each log file you have. One effective approach
          is to separate your logging needs into roles and
          classifications. For instance, a network connection component
          may have logging roles of "connections", "traffic" and "client".
        
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
          If you have already decomposed your system into
          components, then you have one set of categories defined. I
          would use a shorthand name for the category names for simple
          reference (e.g. "resource" instead of
          "org.apache.avalon.excalibur.resource.ResourceManager"). The
          simplified names can be used for a broad set of
          classes. Using the same example, the name "resource" implies
          the Resource class, its manager, and anything that is
          directly associated with the concept of a "resource".
        
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
          You can also use classifications as a specialization of
          the role. Typically
          classifications are sub-categories. For instance, the full
          name of the "component" category would be
          "resource.component". This means that we are referring to the
          "component" classification for the "resource" role.
        
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
          Most of your logging needs can be organized into this two
          dimensional cross-section of Role and Classification. Roles are
          best for main categories due to their logical
          separation. Typical classifications are "component", "security",
          and "pool". These same classifications can be used as standard
          sub-categories of the different roles. This way your log entries
          can have fine-grained control that is logically organized.

    <p>
      
          The mechanics of log writing can vastly affect the
          performance of your code. For instance, if you concatenate several
          strings together in your log messages, the Java Virtual Machine
          converts the concatenation to a StringBuffer, and performs the
          expensive 
    <code>
      toString
    </code>
    operation on the result. The
          
    <code>
      Logger
    </code>
    interface provides a mechanism to optimize away
          these conversions when they are not needed. It is fairly important
          for performance reasons to have all your code following the following
          pattern;
        
    </p>
   
    <div id="source">
      <pre>
    if( logger.isDebugEnabled() )
        logger.debug( "Some debug message..." );
     :        
     :     
    if( logger.isInfoEnabled() )
        logger.info( "some complex info message" );
     :        
     :     
    if( logger.isWarnEnabled() )
        logger.warn( "WARNING! " );
     :        
     :     
    if( logger.isErrorEnabled() )
        logger.error( "We had some problems..." );
</pre>
    </div>
  
    <p>
      
          Finally, each logging system supports different types of log output
          destinations and formatting. It is important to study the performance
          impact on each of these features. For instance, Log4J can provide
          source file and line number of where the log message was called from,
          which is VERY expensive call, although very convenient in debugging
          environments, it must be taken out during production. Another example
          is to investigate the possible speed improvements of using 
          asynchronous targets and buffered streams.

    <em>
      It is not uncommon for many applications that unchecked logging 
          result in negative speed impacts of a magnitude or more.
