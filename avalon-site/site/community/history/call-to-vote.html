        <h3>
          <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a>
        </h3>
      
      
    <p>
      
        I spent some time thinking about some of the issues that were
        discussed on this list in the last month, after the first
        release of Apache JServ 1.0b and after the development
        pressure was reduced.
      
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
        It is clear, to me and to others on this list, that Apache
        JServ 1.0 just barely scratched the potentials of this project
        in sharing IQ and ideas aiming to fill those gaps the advent
        of the Java technology on the server world produced.
      
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
        It is also clear, from different perspectives (users,
        developers, software engineers, management people), that
        servers are a big part of the present/future of everyday work
        and that Java allows the creation of performance oriented,
        solid and rapid-delivered server solutions. Other languages do
        not perform as good when all these three "forces" are
        evaluated together (besides, maybe, SmallTalk, but this is
        another issue).
      
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
        Java is trendy, that's true, but we all know that Java is a
        well-designed object oriented language. May not be the best, I
        grant that, but it's the only one that came to please all
        those people I listed above.
      
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
        Following this direction, and feeling the lack of professional
        Java server solutions on many fields, the Java Apache Project
        was created to fill this gap using the power of open
        source. We don't want to compete with Apache or with any other
        server implementation. We are betting on Java for the server
        side, but we will never "rewrite" some server implementation
        in Java, unless this can lead to significant improvements and
        doesn't go against other open source projects.
      
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
        The final goal is a family of 100% pure server solutions for
        the Java Virtual Machine.
      
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
        Since server applications share lots of logic/code between
        them, it is obvious that a common server framework, along with
        design rules and abstract implementations, would allow faster
        time-to-market, easier code management, parallel development,
        bug fix reflection on all projects and tight integration
        between the different server solutions.
      
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
        I do believe that the time taken to design and develop such a
        framework will be "invested" by this project and its
        developers. The creation of this project doesn't mean other
        projects can't continue to evolve: the final goal is to
        integrate existing server solutions (JServ) into the framework
        but this is not a short term goal so this doesn't influence
        it's evolution/time-to-market for future releases/features.

    <p>
      
        For the reasons above, I propose the creation of a new project
        to handle the design of a the Java Apache Server Framework
        that will be the foundation on which all server projects
        hosted by the Java Apache Project will be based on.

    <li>
      
          Creation and implementation of this framework (interfaces, abstract classes,
          and shared modules).
        
    </li>
   
        
    <li>
      
          Centralized management of the evolution/fixing/patching of both the shared
          code and the framework design.

    <p>
      
        It's a design methodology that allows design reuse as well as
        code reuse between different server projects. These projects
        gain the advantage of software reuse and the simplicity of
        developing/managing only the different logic.
      
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
        This framework will be based on Java technology and would allow: 
      
    </p>
   
    <ol>
      
        
    <li>
      
          Partition of shared logic context into polymorphic modules that are used
          through their public interfaces and not through their actual implementation (Log
          systems, Object stores, Virtual File Systems, Configuration repository,
          Concurrency Strategies, etc..)
        
    </li>
   
        
    <li>
      
          Creation of a common lifecycle for server operations (the Service
          interface)
        
    </li>
   
        
    <li>
      
          Creation of a ServiceManager for service management (maybe both internal
          or external the JVM: native wrapping and control via JNI would allow
          better fault tolerance for the JVM through process separation)

          Shared resources can be either centralized or duplicated for each service,
          allowing the use of a single JVM for multiple servers and common logic
          sharing (i.e. common thread pools, log systems and configuration
          repositories...)

          A central access point for configuration (via HTTP, SMTP, voice, RMI,
          SNMP, IIOP, depending on the services implemented)

          Reduced effort in service development since they become plugins for this
          framework and reuse big parts of the code base. The design and behavior is
          also documented and shared between different services.
