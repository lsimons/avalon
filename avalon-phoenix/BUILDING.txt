               Building The Phoenix Application Server
               =======================================

This subproject contains the source code @@Name@@ @@short-version@@, a container 
that implements a Service API similar to the API under development in the JSR 111, 
Services Framework.  In order to build a binary distribution version of the 
container from a source distribution, you must have a Java Development Kit (JDK) 
for version 1.3 (or later) downloaded and installed (version 1.3.1 recommended), 
and do the following:

(0) Download and Install a Java Development Kit

* Download a Java Development Kit (JDK) release (version 1.3 or later) from:

    http://java.sun.com/j2se/

* Install the JDK according to the instructions included with the release.

* Set an environment variable JAVA_HOME to the pathname of the directory
  into which you installed the JDK release.


(1) Download and Install the Ant Binary Distribution

* Download a binary distribution of Ant 1.4.1 from:

    http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-ant/release/v1.4.1/bin/

  On a Windows platform, you will need:
    jakarta-ant-1.4.1-bin.zip
    jakarta-ant-1.4.1-optional.jar

  On a Unix platform, you will need:
    jakarta-ant-1.4.1-bin.tar.gz
    jakarta-ant-1.4.1-optional.jar

* Unpack the binary distribution into a convenient location so that the
  Ant release resides in its own directory (conventionally named
  "jakarta-ant-1.4.1").  For the purposes of the remainder of this document,
  the symbolic name "${ant.home}" is used to refer to the full pathname of
  the release directory.

* Copy the file "jakarta-ant-1.4.1-optional.jar", downloaded above, into
  the directory "${ant.home}/lib".  This makes available several Ant
  extension commands that are commonly required when building Jakarta
  based projects.

* Modify the PATH environment variable to include directory
  "${ant.home}/bin" in its list.  This makes the "ant" command line script
  available, which will be used to actually perform the build.

(2) Download and Install the JMX 1.0 Reference Implementation

NOTE:  This step is only required if you wish to build the Config/Admin
component of Phoenix.

* Download the JMX Instrumentation and Agent Reference Implementation
  (version 1.0 or later) from

    http://java.sun.com/products/JavaManagement/download.html

* Unpack the reference implementation into a convenient location so that
  it resides in its own subdirectory.

(3) Build A Binary Distribution

Open a command line shell, and issue the following commands:

  cd @@name@@-@@version@@
  ant -projecthelp

If everything is installed correctly, you should see a list of the Ant
"targets" that represent different commands you might wish to build.  By
convention, the "dist-lite" target creates a binary distribution minus 
the javadocs and other documentation.  To execute it, type the following 
commands:

  cd @@name@@-@@version@@
  ant dist-lite

This will create a complete binary distribution of the subproject (equivalent
in structure to the corresponding binary distribution downloadable from the
Jakarta web site), in the "${tomcat.source}/dist" directory.  It will have
the contents described in the corresponding "README.txt" file.

See the document RUNNING.txt for instructions on how to start up and shut down
the Service container.
