    <title>Guide - for Block Developers</title>
    
    <abstract>
      The Block Developer's Guide (BDG) is written to bring an overview
      of how to create and deploy a Block. The Block is the component that
      is hosted in the Phoenix micro-kernel.

    <section><title>Who Should Read This Book?</title>
        <p>The BDG is written for developers who want to create
          blocks for Phoenix. It is assumed that you are familiar with Java, XML, Avalon
          patterns and server side security issues. This book provides an overview of
          the underlying technology, Java classes and interfaces, component model, and
          behavior of server Blocks within Phoenix.</p>
        <p>While this book concentrates on server fundamentals, it should not
          be construed as a &#8220;dummy's&#8220; book. Server side programming
          is complex because of the performance and security issues you must
          balance.</p>
        <p>You should be well versed in the Java language and have some
          practical experience developing server solutions. If you need a stronger
          background on server side programming, I suggest finding a good book on the
          subject (any suggestions?).</p>

      <p>
       Here is how the information is presented. The first few chapters are
       foundational material, and describe the basic concepts you can use in your
       own blocks. The later chapters specify in detail the formal requirements of
       Block implementations.
