      <p>
        Currently deploying a server application under Phoenix is simply a matter
        of dropping the .sar file into the appropriate directory (<code>apps/</code>)
        and restarting Phoenix. In the future there will be more advanced methods
        of deploying and undeploying Server Applications without restarting Phoenix.

          This documentation describes the methods through which you can deploy
          Server Applications under the Phoenix kernel. It will be expanded as
          the system becomes more complete.
