    <section><title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
        Phoenix is a micro-kernel designed and implemented on top of the Avalon
        framework.
        It provides a number of facilities to manage the
        environment of Server Applications. Such facilities include log management,
        classloading, thread management and security. In the future it will
        conditionally support extra facilities such as central server management,
        server pools, and other facilities aimed at reducing the time to market. The API
        defines a standard method of piecing together server components and creating a server.

        This guide starts with an architectural overview of Phoenix. Then, we identify
