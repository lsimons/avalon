        Avalon Phoenix is a micro-kernel designed and implemented on top of
        the Avalon Framework. It is both an API to program to and a reference
        implementation. The reference implementation provides a number of
        facilities to manage the environment of Server Applications. Such
        facilities include log management, classloading, thread management and
        security. In the future it will conditionally offer support extra
        facilities such as central server management, server pools, and other
        facilities aimed at reducing the time to market. The API defines a
        standard method of piecing togther server components and creating a
        server.
