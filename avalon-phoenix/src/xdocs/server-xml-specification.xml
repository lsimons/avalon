      <p>
        The purpose of the <code>server.xml</code> file is to configure Server 
        Application wide settings. Currently this means being able to set the 
        security policy and configure logging settings. A sample <code>server.xml</code> 
        follows. Previously thread pool settings were also configured in this 
        section but this has been deprecated.

      <p>
        The format of the policy section should be self evident if the assembler 
        has experienve with standard policy files. It should be noted that if no 
        policy section is given then the Server Application runs at full permissions.
        The evaluation of properties occurs in a similar manner to standard 
        policy file property expansion. There are a number of extra properties that 
        will be evaluated. These include; <code>app.home</code> and <code>app.name</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The logs section can currently have two types of elements; <em>log-target</em>s 
        which represent destinations for logging and <em>category</em>s. There must be a
        log-target with the name "default". Categories are hierarchial in nature, have a 
        priority and are associated with one or more log-targets. See the logging 
        documentation for a further description of this section.
