        Avalon is a Server Framework that provides or will provide for
        central administration, server pooling, and quicker time to market.
        The framework defines a standard method of piecing together server
        components and creating a server.

          We currently have no info on this whatsoever. However, this doesn't
	  mean that Phoenix is not easy to administrate - the contrary is true,
	  since our tight integration with JMX exposes the entire kernel at
	  runtime.
