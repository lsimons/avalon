        The purpose of the <code>environment.xml</code> file is to configure environmental
        or Server Application wide settings. Currently this means being able to set the
        security policy and configure logging settings. A sample <code>environment.xml</code>
        follows. Previously thread pool settings were also configured in this
        section but this has been deprecated. Note that previously the information stored in
        <code>environment.xml</code> was stored in a file named <code>server.xml</code>.

      <p>
        The format of the policy section should be largely self evident if the assembler
        has experience with standard policy files. It should be noted that if no
        policy section is given then the Server Application runs at full permissions.
        The evaluation of properties occurs in a similar manner to standard
        policy file property expansion. There are a number of extra properties that
        will be evaluated. These include; <code>app.home</code> and <code>app.name</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        One special thing to not is that the user can use URLs of the form,
        "sar:/SAR-INF/lib/*". This will apply the permissions to the jars
        contained in the .SAR file. Note that these urls must start with
        "sar:/" and must use the "/" character as file separator, regardless
        of current operating system.
      </p>
      <p>
        The logs section can currently have two types of elements; <em>log-target</em>s
        which represent destinations for logging and <em>category</em>s. There must be a
        log-target with the name "default". Categories are hierarchial in nature, have a
        priority and are associated with one or more log-targets. See the logging
        documentation for a further description of this section.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is another type of log configuration. It is more configurable.
        Specify version attribute with logs elements. See javadoc of
        org.apache.avalon.excalibur.logger package for detailed description.
        Below is example configuration.
