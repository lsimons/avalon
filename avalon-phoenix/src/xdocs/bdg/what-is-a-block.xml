    <section name="Introduction">
      <p>In Avalon Phoenix, there are three component layers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Blocks</li>
          <li>Components</li>
          <li>Classes</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        They represent ever narrowing views of a component based architecture.
        The best analogy is that of hardware.  In the PC world, a Block would
        be like a PCI card, a Motherboard, a Case, or a Hard Drive.  A Component
        would be like the chips on the cards.  And classes would be like the
        individual transistors on the chip.  Granted, the actual economies
        of scale in this analogy don't hold to software (a component will
        not have millions of classes).

      <p>
        A Block is a Component on a larger scale. It is usually the
        implementation of a Service. Examples of Blocks are
        "Persistent Object Store", "Connection Pools", "XML Database",
        "Authenticator" and so on.
