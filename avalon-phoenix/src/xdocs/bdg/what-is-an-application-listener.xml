        This is very similar to <em>BlockListener</em> in that it is notified
        during lifecycle of blocks and application.  In Java terms the
        <em>ApplicationListener</em> interface extends <em>BlockListener</em>
        so it is always informd of both types of events

      <p>
        ApplicationListener components are created before any Blocks are
        created in an Application. They receive notifications before and
        after the Applictaion is started and stopped.

      <p>
        Like normal blocks, an application listener can be <em>LogEnabled</em>
        and take configuration via <em>Configurable</em>.  The special feature
        is that it must implement <em>ApplicationListener</em> and implement
        the four methods that are a consequence of that (as well as four from
        <em>BlockListener</em>).  The following section in assembly.xml causes
        instantiation of the application listener.  It is exactly the same as
        that for <em>BlockListener</em>:
