      <p>
        In Phoenix, a Server Application is a set of Blocks that act in concert
        to provide a unified user service. Example Server Applications include a Mail 
        Server, File Server, Web Server etc. The Server Application is a high level 
        component that contains a set of Block components.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Server Application requires a number of components other than Blocks to 
        be complete. A Server Application requires configuration files to define 
        Server Application wide settings (threading, security, logging), to define
        how blocks are wired together, and to define configuration data for the 
        Block instances. A Block can also require other resources that are 
        application specific.
