        Avalon Phoenix is a micro-kernel designed and implemented on top of
        the Avalon Framework. It is both an API to program to and a reference
        implementation. The reference implementation provides a number of
        facilities to manage the environment of Server Applications. Such
        facilities include log management, JMX management, classloading and 
        security. The API defines a standard method of piecing togther server 
        components and creating a server.
