<h1>HelloWorld Demo</h1>
<center>By Paul Hammant</center>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> The 'Hello World' demo server component is a socket listener app
that replies 'Hello World' to client applications that open the port. 
The reply is in HTML form so can be viewed by a Browser.  The HTTP
headers are missing, but it still works.  Telnet is another client that
can view the message. </p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p> The following shows how the HelloWorld demo block depends on
ConnectionManager from cornerstone.  These         two blocks packaged
as a server application (.SAR file) are loaded and launched by Phoenix,
itself sitting on top of Avalon's framework. </p>
<h2>Relevant source modules</h2>
<p> The HelloWorld demo compiles as part of the build process for
avalon-apps demo.  The important modules that contribute to the demo
are listed here.  All are within the src directory </p>
<ol>
  <li> <b>org.apache.avalon.apps.demos.helloworldserver package</b> This
package contains the Java source for 'Hello World' and the xinfo block
descriptor. </li>
  <li> <b>conf\avalon-demo-assembly.xml</b> This contains the assembly
instructions for the resulting server archive (sar) file. </li>
  <li> <b>conf\avalon-demo-config.xml</b> This contains the
configuration for the resulting server archive (sar) file. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Java Source</h2>
<h2>HelloWorldHandler.java</h2>
<p> Instantiated and dispatched by the impl once per socket request that
comes in. </p>
<h2>HelloWorldServer.java</h2>
<p> The interface that's the contract for the Server block.  As it
happens HelloWorld is not that resusable.  If it were
"ObjectDataBase.java" many server apps could use it through this
interface.  The interface could set more useful things that the
greeting ("Hello", "Bonjour" etc.) </p>
<h2>HelloWorldServerImpl.java</h2>
<p> This like all impls implements an interface.  Which interface is
rather obvious in this case. It's a standard pattern that uses other
blocks (SocketManager and ConnectionManager) to do the hard work of
listening on a port, pooling threads and connections and organizing
socket invokations in a queue and multi app friendly way. </p>
<h2>avalon-demo-assembly xml</h2>
<p> The file is renamed as part of the build process to assembly.xml,
and only has a separate name here to aid development.  The bulk of the
contents of the file pertain to other blocks including ones that
HelloWorld is dependant upon.  Here's the section that's for HelloWorld
 </p>
<pre>(text snipped)<br>    &lt;block class="org.apache.avalon.apps.demos.helloworldserver.HelloWorldServerImpl"<br>           name="helloworldserver" &gt;<br>        &lt;provide name="socketsection" role="org.apache.avalon.cornerstone.services.sockets.SocketManager"/&gt;<br>        &lt;provide name="connections"<br>                 role="org.apache.avalon.cornerstone.services.connection.ConnectionManager" /&gt;<br>    &lt;/block&gt;<br>(text snipped)<br></pre>
<p> Of the block element, listed attributes are the instatiatable class
implementing the HelloWorld interface (not mentioned itself in this
assembly xml), the display name of the block, and two services that
HelloWorld needs. </p>
<h2>avalon-demo-config xml</h2>
<p> The file is renamed as part of the build process to config.xml, and
only has a separate name here to aid development.  Again here is the
pertinent section: </p>
<pre>(text snipped)<br>        &lt;helloworldserver&gt;<br>          &lt;port&gt;8999&lt;/port&gt;<br>          &lt;bind&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/bind&gt;<br>          &lt;helloworldhandler&gt;<br>             &lt;connectiontimeout&gt; 360000 &lt;/connectiontimeout&gt;<br>          &lt;/helloworldhandler&gt;<br>        &lt;/helloworldserver&gt;<br>(text snipped)<br></pre>
<p> The configuration element named &lt;helloworldserver&gt; is used as
it's name suggests and is passed the blocks being used for the app.
Elements port and bind are used by the socket manager. </p>
<p> If you had configuration for an app, you'd specify it here in with
element and attribute names that are invented for the application.     </p>
<h2>Starting your own server project</h2>
<p> Familiarity with Ant and it's build script would be a good place to
start.  After learning how Cornerstone compiles and jars the demos
would be a good second step.  Thirdly, as I've done before, take the
demos out of Cornerstone, delete classes and xml not relating to the
HelloWorld server and rename from HelloWorld to whatever suits you.  I
import into the lib dir avalon-cornerstone-compilation-0.x.jar to allow
things that use it to compile.  I also import cornerstone-0.x.bar to
the same place to allow it's inclusion in the sar file being made.  The
build xml file even contains a target that allow you to install the
freshly made sar file into a nearby Avalon installation - "build
install", though for development you'll initially only be running
"build" and "build clean".</p>
