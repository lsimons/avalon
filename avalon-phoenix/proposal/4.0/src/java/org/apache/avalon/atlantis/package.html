<html><body>This part of the specification defines the interface an Avalon application
server should implement. It is an optional part - an Avalon implementation
does not have to implement Atlantis to be compatible. The reference
implementation of Atlantis can be found in the
<code>org.apache.phoenix.engine</code> package.
