hi!

This is a sort of 'pre-alpha' of what might be the next version
of Phoenix. Add the latest sources from the avalon proposal CVS,
as well as the sources from logkit to the source tree. Then add
the files from the lib and tool dirs from the avalon, logkit and
phoenix trees to their respective dirs.

You can build using build.bat.

Only tested on windows 98 first edition; unix and NT scripting is out-
of-date.
