<title>How is the Component Going to be Used?</title>
        <p>
          The first step in writing the component is determining how it is going
          to be used.  There will be a number of times where you have a powerful
          component that can be used in many different contexts.  Those contexts
          may include executing the component from the command line (separate
          from Avalon), using it as a part of a sub system, or using it as an
          integral part of Avalon.
        </p>
        <section>
<title>Part of Avalon</title>
          <p>
            All components are an integral part of Avalon, so there is really
            nothing to be done beyond specifying its interface (role).  It is
            important to identify and document its social contract with the
            rest of the system.  What I mean by social contract is the order
            of dependencies, what it needs to function, and what it supplies
            to the rest of the system.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
<title>Part of a Sub System</title>
          <p>
            A sub system can either be part of Avalon, or live in a separate
            context.  A perfect example would be a component that can function
            within a Servlet or Enterprise Application.  Neither of those
            contexts are native to Avalon (though they can easily be built
            on top of Avalon).
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to do even more careful planning than in the
            first scenario.  The reason is that you want the interface to be
            as generic as possible and still accurately represent its role.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because the contexts may not be an integral part of Avalon,
            you must take care to use the component in the same manner as
            Avalon would.  That means that you follow the order of concerns
            that Avalon has specified for those concerns.
          </p>

<title>A Stand Alone Program</title>
          <p>
            When you are designing a component to be run from the command
            line (or directly by the operating system), try to separate
            the main function from the component itself.  This is imperative
            in order to maintain the passive API of Avalon.  By designing
            your component in the manner stated in the previous section,
            you have effectively minimized what the main function has to
            do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Follow the practice of having an object dedicated to the main
            function that includes the parsing of the command line parameters
            and initialization of the component.  When the component is used
            the exact same way in every context (including the command line),
            you minimize the number of locations to look while debugging.
          </p>
          <note>
            A common mistake is to combine the main function in the
            implementation of the component.  This requires violating the
            contracts and principles that Avalon is built upon.  This
            violation of the pattern of "Inversion of Control" is
            aptly dubbed "Subversion of Control" (thanks to Steven Coffman
            for the name of the anti-pattern).
