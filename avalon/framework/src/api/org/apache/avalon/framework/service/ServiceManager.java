/**
 * A <code>ServiceManager</code> selects <code>Object</code>s based on a
 * role.  The contract is that all the <code>Object</code>s implement the
 * differing roles and there is one <code>Object</code> per role.  If you
 * need to select on of many <code>Object</code>s that implement the same
 * role, then you need to use a <code>ServiceSelector</code>.  Roles are
 * usually the full interface name.
 *
 * A role is better understood by the analogy of a play.  There are many
 * different roles in a script.  Any actor or actress can play any given part
 * and you get the same results (phrases said, movements made, etc.).  The exact
 * nuances of the performance is different.
 *
 * Below is a list of things that might be considered the different roles:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li> InputAdaptor and OutputAdaptor</li>
 *   <li> Store and Spool</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The <code>ServiceManager</code> does not specify the methodology of
 * getting the <code>Object</code>, merely the interface used to get it.
 * Therefore the <code>ServiceManager</code> can be implemented with a
 * factory pattern, an object pool, or a simple Hashtable.
