website:   http://avalon.apache.org/framework/
version:   4.1.4

The Avalon Framework consists of interfaces that define relationships
between commonly used application components, best-of-practice pattern
enforcements, and several lightweight convenience implementations of
the generic components.

More documentation?
===================
We do not distribute all our documentation through releases. Rather,
you are encouraged to visit our website at
    http://avalon.apache.org/framework/
for more information.

Building from source?
=====================
The avalon buildfiles use a common buildsystem which utilizes maven and
forrest. You will need to download and install maven, the
maven-forrest-plugin, and the avalon-buildsystem module.
