Apache Avalon is a collaborative software development project dedicated to
providing a high-quality freely available component architecture according to
the principles of the Apache Software Foundation [ASF].

This charter briefly describes the mission, history, organization, and
processes of the Apache Avalon project.

MISSION
=======

Apache Avalon exists to promote and facilitate Component Based Design.
Component Based Design is a proven practice that helps create systems that are
loosely coupled and easy to maintain. Component Based Design requires a rigid
software framework to function properly.

Apache Avalon provides a specification for such a framework, an implementation
of that specification and a compliance testing suite, and tools and components
to facilate development using that framework.

The software developed by the Apache Avalon project must be high performance,
reliable, secure, and easy to use.  The individual software components must be
part of an underlying architectural orchestration that will allow them to work
together without major negotiations or breakage.

The process followed for the development of Apache Avalon software is the same
as the process followed by other ASF projects: individuals and corporations
collaborate on the best possible infrastructure, APIs, code, testing, and
release cycles.

In order to achieve a coherent architecture between Apache Avalon components
and other components and applications, standards (formal or de facto) will be
used as much as possible for both protocols and APIs. We will also allow the
innovation of new protocols, APIs, and components in order to seed new concepts
not yet defined by standards.

HISTORY
=======

This project was established under the direction of the Apache Software
Foundation in November 2002 to facilitate joint open-source development.

THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE
================================
The Apache Avalon project is managed by a small, core group of contributors
known as the Project Management Committee [PMC].  The PMC must have at least
one ASF Officer, who will also be the PMC Chairperson and who will report to
the ASF Board.  See http://www.apache.org/foundation/bylaws.html for reference.

The PMC has the following responsibilities:

o Facilitating code or other donations by individuals or companies.
o Resolving license issues and other legal issues.
o Approving new committers.
o Ensuring that administrative and infrastructure work is completed.
o Overseeing Apache Avalon to ensure that the mission defined in
  this document is being fulfilled.
o Resolving conflicts within the project.

To become a member of the PMC, an individual must be nominated by a
contributor, unanimously approved by all PMC members, and approved by a
two-thirds majority of committers. In most cases, developers will have actively
contributed to development for at least six months before being considered for
membership on the PMC.

The PMC is responsible for maintaining and updating this charter. Development
must follow the process outlined in this charter, so any change to the
development process necessitates a change to the charter. Changes must be
unanimously approved by all members of the PMC. A contributor may challenge a
change to the charter at any time and ask for a vote of all committers, in
which case a two-thirds majority must approve the change.

COMMITTERS
==========

Committers are developers who have read/write access to the source code
repository. New committers are added when a developer is nominated by a
committer and approved by at least 50 percent of the existing committers with
no opposing votes.  In most cases, new committers will already be participating
in the development process by submitting suggestions and/or fixes via the bug
report page or mailing lists.

CONTRIBUTORS
============
Anyone is allowed and encouraged to participate in the development of the
Apache Avalon software products. Occasional contributors will be able to
report bugs, participate in the mailing lists, and submit patches.

Specific changes to a product proposed for discussion or voting on the
appropriate development mailing list should be presented in the form of
patches. When sent to the mailing list, the message should contain a subject
beginning with [PATCH] and include a clear summary that describes the effect of
that patch.

Like all Apache projects, the Avalon project is a meritocracy -- the more work
you do, the more you are allowed to do.  Developers who make regular and
substantial contributions may become committers as described above.

LICENSING
=========
All contributions to the Apache Avalon project adhere to the "ASF Source Code
License." All contributions must be made under those terms. All
contributions must contain the following copyright notice and license:

THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
=======================
The development process is intentionally lightweight and follows the same
guidelines as other ASF projects. The project committers decide which changes
may be committed to the repository. Three +1 ('yes' votes) with no -1 ('no'
votes or vetoes) are needed to approve a code change. For efficiency, some code
changes from some contributors (e.g. feature additions, bug fixes) may be
approved in advance, in which case they may be committed first and changed as
needed, with conflicts resolved by majority vote of the committers.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS
====================
All software products developed by Apache Avalon must have a set of requirments
as well as an up-to-date release plan and architecture design. All software
products developed by Apache Avalon must have a test system to verify their
correct functioning and are ideally subject to continous integration testing,
regression testing and unit testing.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER APACHE PROJECTS
=====================================
The Apache Avalon project should work closely with other Apache projects, such
as Jakarta and Apache HTTP Server, to avoid redundancy and achieve a coherent
architecture among Apache Avalon and these projects.
