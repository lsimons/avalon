  <release version="4.1" date="unreleased">
    <action dev="JT" type="fix">
      Changed access of Enum and ValuedEnum constructors from public to
      protected, to prevent Enum users from breaking type-safety by adding new
      Enum items. This breaks backwards-compatibility in cases where Enum
      and ValuedEnum were being incorrectly used.
    </action>
  </release>
  <release version="4.0" date="July 30, 2001">
    <action dev="BL" type="add">
      Added new method to Component Manager and Selector for discovering
      if a Component exists inside or not.  Also augmented the default
      versions with the basic implementation to discover them.
    </action>

      Added stylesheet to convert Stylebook markup to DocBook markup.

    </action>
    <action dev="PD" type="update">
      Add a makeReadOnly() method to the default implementations of Configuration, 
      Context and ComponentManager. Calling this method after the respective
      object has been filled will make the object read-only. This is a safety 
      precaution to stop code performing unwanted operations.

      Updated the javadocs of many of the classes.
