      <p>
        Avalon Excalibur was created in order to ease development of
        new projects.  To that end, Excalibur contains a number of
	ready to use components and utilities that handle everything
	from command line parsing to thread concurrency management.
      </p>
      <p>
        The components in the Excalibur package have been well tested
	and do work reliably.  There is an associated project called
	"Scratchpad" that is a staging area for new Components.  When
	they have been sufficiently tested, we will include them in
	Excalibur.
