               Avalon 4.0 Post Release Issues
               ------------------------------

    The purpose for this file is to document potential issues
that we need to discuss after the Avalon 4.0 Final Release,
and before any maintenance releases (i.e. 4.1, 4.0.1, etc.).
Since I don't want to clutter the mailing list and cause alarm
unnecessarily, I am placing the issues in this list.

    Please use this file to relay any issues that we need to
address after release.

Issues:
-------

* Should we require every Excalibur component to have a package.html
  file with instructions on how to use the components?  This
  should be settled on for Beta 2.

* Should we consider using JUnit for the unit tests instead of
  Testlet?  It would mean less code for us to maintain and
  document.  JUnit has a critical mass surrounding it, and
  documentation--whereas I don't understand Testlet, and the
  only way to do so is to go through the source code.

* What kind of release schedule do we want?  Should be make
  regular releases every 3 months with what we have (i.e.
  bug fixes or new features)?  Or Should we be milestone
  driven?  For Framework/Excalibur I would lean toward the
  regular release approach.

* How do components in Scratchpad be promoted to Excalibur?
  In other words, what are the exit criteria?

* Should we update to use Velocity rather than Stylebook

* Should we wait for commons to build component directory 
  or do it ourselves?

* Should we create a new CVS for excalibur?

* should we write our own doclet to better integrate documentation
  of distributed src files.

* Should we support download of resources via JNLP/CJAN/JJAN

* Should we even store the avalon generated jars (testlet/
  logkit/avalon-*/phoenix-* in CVS or should we suck them between projects
  automagically).

* Should we have a CVS check that reformats code on insert into repository.

* Should we move to docbook DTD

* Should we move stylebook sheets into jakarta-site CVS

* Enhance Parameters so that it can be built from writer/inputstream in such a
  way that it reads in velocity/turbine style parameters
