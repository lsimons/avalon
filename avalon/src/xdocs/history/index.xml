<s1 title="History">

<p>
    This document tracks the history of the Avalon project. Originally started with 
    a realisation that java was a great platform for developing server products and a 
    <link href="call-to-vote.html">call to vote</link>. There was a lot of work 
    formalizing what exactly a <link href="what-is-a-server.html">server</link> consists
    of and why Avalon was <link href="need-for-avalon.html">needed</link>. Theses 
    discussions led to the initial development of Avalon framework.
</p>

<p>
    Overtime the Java Apache Server Framework project was renamed Avalon. This was in 
    recognition that the original ideas have evolved over time. Avalon became a 
    repository of general utility code, a design and testing ground for component based 
    solutions, a micro kernel and generalized server orientated services. This combined 
    with a move from the Java Apache project to the jakarta project promted the revision.
    At this time the kernel code was repackaged under the name phoenix, core services 
    under the name cornerstone and the avalon-independent code was moved to util package.
