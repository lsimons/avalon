<s1 title="Getting Started">

<p>
    This document provides developers with simple documentation for getting
    started with Avalon. For information about the overall structure of
    Avalon, please refer to the <link href="design.html">Design</link> document.
</p>

<p>
    Instructions for downloading and installing Avalon can be found on the
    <link href="install.html">Install</link> document.
</p>    

<p>
    More detailed instructions will be added to this document in the future. Feel free
    to send in patches ;)

<s1 title="View Detailed API Documentation">

<p>    
    To generate a full set of detailed API documentation for Avalon, go to the base
    directory of source distribution and run the appropriate build script for your 
    platform with the parameter 'javadocs'.
    
    <source><![CDATA[
    
    > build.[bat|sh] javadocs
    
    ]]></source>
</p>

</s1>
<s1 title="Run the examples">

<p>
    After you have successfully built Avalon, you can verify that it has
compiled
    correctly by running the demo Service Application. To do so, fire up
phoenix
    with the following command:

    <source><![CDATA[

    > bin/run.[bat|sh]

    ]]></source>
</p>

<p>
    Next, fire up your favorite webbrowser and point it to
http://localhost:8999/,
    where localhost is the network name of your machine ("localhost") should
work
    on all windows platforms.<br />
    If all goes well, you will see something like the following:

    <source><![CDATA[

    Hello World!
    Requests so far = 9
    you are 127.0.0.1 at 127.0.0.1

    ]]></source>
</p>
