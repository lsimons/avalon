    <s1 title="Optimise your resources with pools">
      <p>
        Find Avalon Excalibur's Pool implementations in the
	<code>org.apache.avalon.excalibur.pool</code> package.
	There are many implementations that are ThreadSafe, and
	one that is not.  You have the option of not limiting
	used resources at all, or limiting the used resources
	based on specific rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are using the Exalibur Component Management package,
	you can have your components implement Poolable or Recyclable
	from this package, and your components will be pooled.  The
	Components are pooled with a soft resource limmiting pool.
	That means that as additional resources are needed, they are
	created--but once they are returned to the pool, the extra
	instances are decommissioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Excalibur DataSources package also uses this package,
	and uses a hard resource limiting pool.  If the number of
	open JDBC Connections exceeds the limit, an exception is
	thrown.
