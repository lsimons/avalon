    <s1 title="Step through a pipeline easily">
      <p>
        Avalon Excalibur's pipeline package is located at
	<code>org.apache.avalon.excalibur.pipeline</code> (in the
	Scratchpad jar).  It is designed to allow you to set up
	an arbitrary pipeline that is stepped through.  As each
	stage is retrieved, you can perform any operations on
	it that you need.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pipeline code does function, but it may be restructured
	at any time.
