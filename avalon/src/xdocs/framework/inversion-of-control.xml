    <s1 title="Inversion of Control">
      <p>
        One of the key design principles behind Avalon is the principle
        of <em>Inversion of Control</em>.  <em>Inversion of Control</em> is
        a concept promoted by one of the founders of the Avalon project,
        <link href="mailto:stefano@apache.org">Stefano Mazzocchi</link>.  The
        principle enforces security by design.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is difficult to track down one paper that defines this pattern
        at length, so here are a couple of different definitions of
        <em>Inversion of Control</em>.
      </p>
      <s2 title="What it Means">
        <p>
          The Framework plays the role of the main program in coordinating
          and sequencing events and application activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          A designer sets up a chain among objects that can all react
          to certain messages in a delegation hierarchy.  There is one
	  major semantic detail: Inversion of Control refers to a parent
	  object <em>controlling</em> a child object.  With this distinction,
	  the SAX API is not considered Inversion of Control because its
	  purpose is to send <em>information</em> from a source to a handler.
        </p>
        <s3 title="Definition by Analogy">
          <p>
            There are a couple of different analogies that make
            understanding <em>Inversion of Control</em> easier.  We
            experience this in many different ways in regular life,
            so we are borrowing the form in code.  One analogy is called
	    the &quot;Chain of Command&quot; in the military.
          </p>
          <s4 title="Chain of Command">
            <p>
              This is probably the clearest parallel to <em>Inversion
              of Control</em>.  The military provides each new recruit
              with the basic things they need to operate at their rank,
              and issues commands that recruit must obey.  The same
              principle applies in code.  Each Component is given the
              provisions they need to operate by the instantiating
              entity (i.e. Commanding Officer in this analogy).  The
              instantiating entity then acts on that Component how it
              needs to act.
            </p>
	    <p>
	      There are some deficiencies in this analogy as some military
	      or ex-military people have explained to me.  In the military,
	      <strong>any</strong> Commanding Officer can issue commands to
	      anyone under his or her rank.  In the development world, to
	      ensure proper security, this is not a pattern you want in your
	      software.  In Avalon, Inversion of Control (IoC) is from one
	      parent (controlling) object to a child (controlled) component.
	      A parent may have many children, but children only have one
	      parent.
	    </p>
          </s4>
        </s3>
      </s2>
      <s2 title="How to Apply It">
        <p>
          <em>Inversion of Control</em> is applied in a very simple
          manner.  Basically, it means that the Component architecture
          employs a <em>passive</em> structure.  See the following code:
        </p>
        <source>
class MyComponent 
    implements Component, LogEnabled
{
    Logger logger;

    public enableLogging(Logger newLogger)
    {
        this.logger = newLogger;
    }

    myMethod() 
    {
        logger.info("Hello World!");
    }
}
        </source>
        <p>
          The parent of MyComponent instantiates MyComponent, sets the
          Logger, and calls myMethod.  The Component is not autonomous,
	  and is given a Logger that has been configured by the parent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The MyComponent class has no state apart from the parent, and
          has no way of obtaining a reference to the Logger implementation
          without the parent giving it the implementation it needs.
        </p>
