    <s1 title="Introduction">
      <p>
        I highly recommend reading the essay
        <link href="http://xent.ics.uci.edu/~khare/Alexander.htmld/">
          &quot;On the diffusion of Christopher Alexander's <em>A Pattern
          Language</em> into Software Architecture&quot;
        </link>
        by Rohit Khare.  That essay is a good primer on the principles
        behind Design Patterns and how they came into being.

        Avalon takes many design patterns and architectural mindsets,
        and implements the best ones for Servers.  There are different
        kinds of patterns that represent different aspects of Avalon.
        Avalon uses three main conceptual patterns called Inversion
        of Control, Multi-Dimensional Separation of Concerns, and
        Aspect Oriented Programming.  Avalon also uses several architectural
        patterns like the Singleton and the Factory.  Detailed information
        about all of these patterns will be included in their respective
        pages.
