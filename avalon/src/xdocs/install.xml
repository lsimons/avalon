<s1 title="Installation">

<p>
    Avalon runs on a variety of platforms that have installed the Java 2 Virtual Machine.
    The JSSE (Java Secure Sockets Extention) is required for users who want to compile 
    Avalon to use SSL/TLS facilities.
</p>

<p>
    Everything required to run Avalon and develope Avalon based products comes with the 
    <link href="http://java.apache.org/framework/dist/">distribution</link>. If you wish 
    to help develop Avalon then it is recomended that you obtain the full source tree from
    <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/getinvolved/cvsindex.html">CVS</link> or from the
    <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-avalon/nightly/">nightly builds
    </link>
</p>

</s1>

<s1 title="Compiling">

<p>
    Execute the relavent platform specific script (build.[sh|bat]) in the base avalon directory. 
    Place the JSSE jars into the lib/ sub-directory if you wish to compile in TLS/SSL support. 
</p>    

<p>
    Executing this script will create a <em>dist</em> directory within the Avalon
    distribution directory. The <em>dist</em> directory will contain the 
    compiled class files packaged into jars.
</p>

</s1>

<s1 title="Testing Your Installation">

<p>
    As of the present time there is minimal support for Unit Testing and no support for 
    functional testing. This will change in the future pending changes in ant to support 
    such facilities.
