      <p>
        Phoenix is a micro-kernel designed and implemented on top of the Avalon
        framework. It is both an API to program to and a reference implementation.
        The reference implementation provides a number of facilities to manage the
        environment of Server Applications. Such facilities include log management,
        classloading, thread management and security. In the future it will 
        conditionally offer support extra facilities such as central server management, 
        server pools, and other facilities aimed at reducing the time to market. The API 
        defines a standard method of piecing togther server components and creating a server.
