  <title>Implementing the Dream</title>
  <subtitle>
    We will show how you can use Avalon Framework and Avalon Excalibur to
    realize your services.  We will show just how easy Avalon is to use.

    After your analysis is complete, you need to create the Components and
    Services that make up your system.  Avalon would be of little use if it
    only described some idioms for you to use.  Even then, the use of those
    idioms and patterns would still help in understanding the overall system.
    Avalon Excalibur provides some useful Components and utilities that you can
    incorporate into your own system that will make your life much easier.  For
    our demonstration, we will go through the process of defining a Component
    that retrieves a document instance from a repository.  If you recall our
    discussion about the theoretical Business Server, we identified this
    Component as a Service.  In practical situations, a Service is a Component
    that has a larger scope.
