APACHE AVALON PROJECT STATUS:                          -*-indented-text-*-
Last modified at [$Date: 2003/01/20 08:25:43 $]

Background:

    Apache Avalon is a project started at java.apache.org. 
    It later became an Apache Jakarta subproject.
    It has recently been declared a new top-level project with
    its own PMC.

    See the bottom of this file for the official resolution/
    charter-as-it-stands. See the project website for other information.
       
Release:

    o none scheduled ATM; still defining new container plan and 
      how to best keep development of current code go ahead 
      without impacting negatively on the new work.

    o Phoenix released.
          
    o past releases available from 
         http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-avalon/
    
    o nightlies available from 
         http://cvs.apache.org/builds/jakarta-avalon/nightly/    


Resolved Issues:

    o previously released software needs to be supported, 
      including but not limited to the avalon framework, avalon 
      excalibur and avalon phoenix
      
    o existing avalon users must be supported, including but not limited
      to the XML Cocoon and Jakarta JAMES communities
      
    o we want to strive for as much consensus on future developments as
      possible taking into account the above points

    o There is an Avalon repository called avalon-sandbox to contain 
      all non-released code. It has its own site to make less confusion
      with released products.
      
    o Use a unified avalon-dev mailing list
       (and avalon-user remains separate) 

    o To mark sandbox code clearly as being sandbox code, 
      we do not require that components in this place are 
      put in the package org.apache.avalon.sandbox.X; they
      will use the same package names they will use if/when
      they are graduated in main CVS.

    o Context contract has been updated to reflect
      current usage.
      [http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=103986366100001&r=1&w=2]
      
    o Every committer that will propose an internal fork 
      will have to go thru the community vote to be allowed 
      to do that.

Pending issues:


    o Do you want that all @author tags and all reference to authors of 
      source code files be removed from the files themselves? 
      The information about the authors will still be present in commit 
      messages and in the site credits.

    o The STATUS file is a great mean of synching the community agenda. 
      To be effective, it must be uptodate, and I can't do it all myself. 
      Proposals should be entered as such, votes should have listed all 
      current votes and the vote start date, and when the issue item is 
      completed, the names of the voters are removed and it's resolved, 
      positive or negative. Releases too should be 
      Votes and all action items that are placed in the STATUS file
      are valid if done by their rules. In other words, the STATUS file 
      does not validate them in any way, it's just a community synch tool.
      If something doesn't go into the status file, it still exists and is
      perfectly valid.
      I'm asking you, do you want that for each [Proposal] and [Vote] 
      and release there be an entry in the STATUS file, that has to be 
      updated by the original item proposal?

    o Coming up with a set of bylaws for the project

    o Define the terms for serving as a Chair
      Note: this is actually defined by the bylaws and board
      resolutions, and we have no role in defining this.
    
    o move to avalon.apache.org?

    o  Roadmap
 
       Avalon will be focussing container development into two efforts.
       The first one is the creation of Avalon ESCA. To this end, most 
       existing avalon container projects will refocus to be part of
       that goal.
 
       The roadmap for this effort is roughly as follows:
 
       - Milestone 1:  ECM replacement (Codename: Fortress)
       - Milestone 2:  Proper Meta Model (Codename: Merlin3)
       - Milestone 3:  Phoenix Compatible (Codename: Phoenix5)
       - Milestone 4:  Profileable, pluggable container (Codename: Spearhead)
 
       The second container development effort is the maintainance of existing 
       released efforts with an existing userbase, ie phoenix. This will merge 
       into the ESCA effort when there is an ESCA release compatible with
       those existing efforts.

       ====================================================================



    o discussing and writing short-to-medium term roadmap regarding 
      unused and/or unmaintained and/or alpha-stage software
      packages in current CVSes

    o discussing and writing short-to-medium term roadmap 
      regarding possible relocation of software packages that 
      could have a better home at another avalon project

    o wrap up discussion on licensing headers in sourcefiles

    o Existing committers can start new projects without a
      detour to the Incubator by using the avalon-sandbox, and
      must meet the (TBD) goals of Apache Avalon.
      These new components must be approved by the PMC before 
      being accepted in the endorsed repositories, and must meet the 
      (TBD) goals of Apache Avalon.
      +1: nicolaken
      
    o Voting will follow the "standard Apache voting guidelines"
      [ be nice to refer to an Incubator doc here ]
      
    o All code donations [to the ASF, destined for Apache Avalon]
      arrive via the Incubator, unless the Incubator states they can
      be placed directly into Avalon.
      -1: leosimons - I think that if, for example, our company
          wants to donate avalon-related code to avalon, the best
          body to judge whether the donation should be accepted
          is avalon. If it's about "code-with-a-community", like
          EOB maybe if it comes this way, it's a different story.
      
    o Creation of an "avalon" CVS repository for new Avalon5 
      codebase

    o Proposed by Peter Donald:
      One of the problems that has plagued Avalon is the result
      of one-man codebases. I propose we remove almost all of these
      withing the next month. They can be moved to jakarta-commons, 
      the incubator or to sourceforge as the developer wishes.

    o Come up with a Meta-Info model for Context.

    o Define standard Context entries.

    o Last-minute changes to the Context javadocs.

    o fix the build system (for excalibur) (so that gump gives green light
      again). Do we move to maven? Wait for a 1.0 release perhaps?

    o move over docs to forrest (currently there's a branch in the
      jakarta-avalon module which we need to merge back and move to,
      but there's some stuff left to do).

Project Mission:

Note: work is underway in jakarta-avalon/src/proposal to define a charter,
including mission.

What is the project's mission? Our statement of goals/mission/vision
could arise also from the answers to the following and other questions:
       
      - Should we have a minimum set of requirements before components
        are released?
        +0: nicolaken

      - If yes to above then which things should be part of minimum
        requirements?

        documentation: require basic overview and user docs
        +0: nicolaken

        uptodate website: require website be updated to latest release
                          but may still host previous release docs.
