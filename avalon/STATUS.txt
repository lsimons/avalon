APACHE AVALON PROJECT STATUS:                          -*-indented-text-*-
Last modified at [$Date: 2002/12/05 00:12:24 $]

Background:

    Apache Avalon is a project started at java.apache.org. 
    It later became an Apache Jakarta subproject.
    It has recently been declared a new top-level project with
    its own PMC.

    See the bottom of this file for the official resolution/
    charter-as-it-stands. See the project website for other information.
       
Release:

    o none scheduled ATM; still defining new container plan and 
      how to best keep development of current code go ahead 
      without impacting negatively on the new work.
    
    o past releases available from 
         http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-avalon/
    
    o nightlies available from 
         http://cvs.apache.org/builds/jakarta-avalon/nightly/    


Resolved Issues:

    o previously released software needs to be supported, 
      including but not limited to the avalon framework, avalon 
      excalibur and avalon phoenix
      
    o existing avalon users must be supported, including but not limited
      to the XML Cocoon and Jakarta JAMES communities
      
    o we want to strive for as much consensus on future developments as
      possible taking into account the above points

    o There is an Avalon repository called avalon-sandbox to contain 
      all non-released code. It has its own site to make less confusion
      with released products.
      
    o Use a unified avalon-dev mailing list
       (and avalon-user remains separate) 

      
Pending issues:

    o Coming up with a set of bylaws for the project

    o Define the terms for serving as a Chair
    
    o deciding on moving or not moving to avalon.apache.org

    o discussing and writing medium-to-long term roadmap 
      regarding containers and possible avalon framework extension 
      based on consensus development

    o discussing and writing short-to-medium term roadmap regarding 
      unused and/or unmaintained and/or alpha-stage software
      packages in current CVSes

    o discussing and writing short-to-medium term roadmap 
      regarding possible relocation of software packages that 
      could have a better home at another avalon project

    o wrap up discussion on licensing headers in sourcefiles

    o Existing committers can start new projects without a
      detour to the Incubator by using the avalon-sandbox, and
      must meet the (TBD) goals of Apache Avalon.
      These new components must be approved by the PMC before 
      being accepted in the endorsed repositories, and must meet the 
      (TBD) goals of Apache Avalon.

    o Voting will follow the "standard Apache voting guidelines"
      [ be nice to refer to an Incubator doc here ]
      
    o All code donations [to the ASF, destined for Apache Avalon]
      arrive via the Incubator, unless the Incubator states they can
      be placed directly into Avalon.      
      
    o Creation of an "avalon" CVS repository for new Avalon5 
      codebase

    o Proposed by Peter Donald:      
      Mark sandbox code clearly as being sandbox code. 
      To do this we could require that components in this place are 
      put in the package org.apache.avalon.sandbox.X
      This will make it very clear to users what the status of code 
      is and thus they won't be misled into thinking that it is 
      anything it is not.

    o Proposed by Peter Donald:
      One of the problems that has plagued Avalon is the result
      of one-man codebases. I propose we remove almost all of these
      withing the next month. They can be moved to jakarta-commons, 
      the incubator or to sourceforge as the developer wishes.
      -1: leosutic
        
    o  Every committer that will propose an internal fork 
       will have to go thru the community vote to be allowed 
       to do that.

Project Mission:

What is the project's mission?  Our statement of goals/mission/vision
could arise also from the answers to the following and other questions:
       
      - Should we have a minimum set of requirements before components
        are released?
        +0: nicolaken

      - If yes to above then which things should be part of minimum
        requirements?

        documentation: require basic overview and user docs
        +0: nicolaken

        uptodate website: require website be updated to latest release
                          but may still host previous release docs.

        unit tests: (okay so this will never get consensus but ...)
