APACHE AVALON PROJECT STATUS:                          -*-indented-text-*-
Last modified at [$Date: 2003/02/01 10:20:00 $]

Background:

    Apache Avalon is a project started at java.apache.org. 
    It later became an Apache Jakarta subproject.
    It has recently been declared a new top-level project with
    its own PMC.

    See the bottom of this file for the official resolution/
    charter-as-it-stands. See the project website for other information.
       
Release:

    o We are in the midst of putting together a Release Plan for 
      all Avalon technologies, codenamed ACR (Avalon Coordinated Release)

    o Phoenix released.
          
    o past releases available from 
         http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-avalon/
    
    o nightlies available from 
         http://cvs.apache.org/builds/jakarta-avalon/nightly/    


Resolved Issues:

    o previously released software needs to be supported, 
      including but not limited to the avalon framework, avalon 
      excalibur and avalon phoenix
      
    o existing avalon users must be supported, including but not limited
      to the XML Cocoon and Jakarta JAMES communities
      
    o we want to strive for as much consensus on future developments as
      possible taking into account the above points

    o There is an Avalon repository called avalon-sandbox to contain 
      all non-released code. It has its own site to make less confusion
      with released products.
      
    o Use a unified avalon-dev mailing list
       (and avalon-user remains separate) 

    o To mark sandbox code clearly as being sandbox code, 
      we do not require that components in this place are 
      put in the package org.apache.avalon.sandbox.X; they
      will use the same package names they will use if/when
      they are graduated in main CVS.

    o Context contract has been updated to reflect
      current usage.
      [http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=103986366100001&r=1&w=2]
      
    o Every committer that will propose an internal fork 
      will have to go thru the community vote to be allowed 
      to do that.       
      [http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=avalon-dev&m=103903695931512&w=2]
      [http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=103904717500001&r=1&w=2]
      [http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=103908800800002&r=1&w=2]
      
    o All @author tags and all reference to authors of source code files
      will be also kept in the files themselves.

    o Avalon PMC Voting Procedures accepted 2003-01-31
      Proposal: [http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=avalon-dev&m=104339946013500&w=2]
      Result:   [http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=avalon-dev&m=104400855421800&w=2]

    o The STATUS file is a great means of synching the community agenda. 
      For each [Proposal] and [Vote] 
      and release there be an entry in the STATUS file, that has to be 
      updated by the original item proposal.
      Proposals should be entered as such, votes should have listed all 
      current votes and the vote start date, and when the issue item is 
      completed, the names of the voters are removed and it's resolved, 
      positive or negative. Releases too should be listed.
      *NOTE*
      Votes and all action items that are placed in the STATUS file
      are valid if done by their rules. In other words, the STATUS file 
      does not validate them in any way, it's just a community synch 
      tool. If something doesn't go into the status file, it 
      still exists and is perfectly valid.

      
Pending issues:

    o nicolaken: Deprecation policy
      Removing deprecated classes between major versions is a safe bet.
      Between point versions it's a possibility.
      Between fixes it's an error.
      I'd suggest the following as a guideline:
       - deprecating classes results in @deprecated being added
       - in the next minor point release, they are moved to a
         deprecated source tree for the component that is compiled
         *after* the main ones, so that we are sure that /we/ do not
         rely on those.
       - in the major releases the classes can be removed with a vote.

    o nicolaken: Previously, I had asked that the maven descriptor in 
      the avalon CVS not be in the main dir, not to confuse our users.
      But it's also possible that we just don't include it in the
      releases.
      Given that there is much discussion on things that developers 
      don't even know what is about, I think it's in the best 
      interest of all Avalon that build tools alternative to Ant 
      are included in the correct places in our projects so that 
      all developers can evaluate them and decide on merit rather 
      than feeling.
      This of course also means that we accept the POMs from Jason,
      and can commit any other build system too for comparative 
      evaluation.
      What do you guys think, is this reasonable?

    o [VOTE] Do you want that we discuntinue Excalibur CLI in favor of 
      Jakarta Commons CLI?

    o Coming up with a set of bylaws for the project

    o Define the terms for serving as a Chair
      Note: this is actually defined by the bylaws and board
      resolutions, and we have no role in defining this.
    
    o  Roadmap
 
       Avalon will be focussing container development into two efforts.
       The first one is the creation of Avalon ESCA. To this end, most 
       existing avalon container projects will refocus to be part of
       that goal.
 
       The roadmap for this effort is roughly as follows:
 
       - Milestone 1:  ECM replacement (Codename: Fortress)
       - Milestone 2:  Proper Meta Model (Codename: Merlin3)
       - Milestone 3:  Phoenix Compatible (Codename: Phoenix5)
       - Milestone 4:  Profileable, pluggable container (Codename: Spearhead)
 
       The second container development effort is the maintainance of existing 
       released efforts with an existing userbase, ie phoenix. This will merge 
       into the ESCA effort when there is an ESCA release compatible with
       those existing efforts.

       ====================================================================



    o discussing and writing short-to-medium term roadmap regarding 
      unused and/or unmaintained and/or alpha-stage software
      packages in current CVSes

    o discussing and writing short-to-medium term roadmap 
      regarding possible relocation of software packages that 
      could have a better home at another avalon project

    o wrap up discussion on licensing headers in sourcefiles

    o Existing committers can start new projects without a
      detour to the Incubator by using the avalon-sandbox, and
      must meet the (TBD) goals of Apache Avalon.
      These new components must be approved by the PMC before 
      being accepted in the endorsed repositories, and must meet the 
      (TBD) goals of Apache Avalon.
      +1: nicolaken
      
    o Voting will follow the "standard Apache voting guidelines"
      [ be nice to refer to an Incubator doc here ]
      
    o All code donations [to the ASF, destined for Apache Avalon]
      arrive via the Incubator, unless the Incubator states they can
      be placed directly into Avalon.
      -1: leosimons - I think that if, for example, our company
          wants to donate avalon-related code to avalon, the best
          body to judge whether the donation should be accepted
          is avalon. If it's about "code-with-a-community", like
          EOB maybe if it comes this way, it's a different story.
      
    o Come up with a Meta-Info model for Context.

    o Define standard Context entries.

    o Last-minute changes to the Context javadocs.

    o fix the build system (for excalibur) (so that gump gives green light
      again). Do we move to maven? Wait for a 1.0 release perhaps?

    o move over docs to forrest (currently there's a branch in the
      jakarta-avalon module which we need to merge back and move to,
      but there's some stuff left to do).

Project Mission:

Note: work is underway in jakarta-avalon/src/proposal to define a charter,
including mission.

What is the project's mission? Our statement of goals/mission/vision
could arise also from the answers to the following and other questions:
       
      - Should we have a minimum set of requirements before components
        are released?

      - If yes to above then which things should be part of minimum
        requirements?

        documentation: require basic overview and user docs

        uptodate website: require website be updated to latest release
                          but may still host previous release docs.

        unit tests: (okay so this will never get consensus but ...)
