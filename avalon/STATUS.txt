APACHE AVALON PROJECT STATUS:                          -*-indented-text-*-
Last modified at [$Date: 2002/12/03 08:19:47 $]

   
Release:
    none ATM; still defining new container plan and how to best keep
    development of current code go ahead without impacting negatively on
    the new work.


Resolved Issues:

    o There is an Avalon repository called avalon-sandbox to contain 
      all non-released code. It has its own site to make less confusion
      with released products.
      
    o Use a unified avalon-dev mailing list (and avalon-user remains separate)

      -0: leosimons 
      -1: hammant, leif
      
Pending issues:
    o Coming up with a set of bylaws for the project

    o Define the terms for serving as a Chair
    
    o Definition of a new contract for the Context interface, which
      is the pivot issue of our component protability.

    o Switch to a avalon.apache.org website and @avalon.apache.org
      mailing lists.
      
    o Existing committers can start new projects without a
      detour to the Incubator by using the avalon-sandbox, and
      must meet the (TBD) goals of Apache Avalon.
      These new components must be approved by the PMC before 
      being accepted in the endorsed repositories, and must meet the 
      (TBD) goals of Apache Avalon.
      +1: nicolaken
      
    o Voting will follow the "standard Apache voting guidelines"

      [ be nice to refer to an Incubator doc here ]
      
    o All code donations [to the ASF, destined for Apache Avalon]
      arrive via the Incubator, unless the Incubator states they can
      be placed directly into Avalon.      
      
Project Mission:

What is the project's mission?  Our statement of goals/mission/vision
should arise from the answers to the following and other questions:
       
      - Should we have a minimum set of requirements before components
        are released?
        +0: nicolaken

      - If yes to above then which things should be part of minimum
        requirements?

        documentation: require basic overview and user docs
        +0: nicolaken

        uptodate website: require website be updated to latest release
                          but may still host previous release docs.

        unit tests: (okay so this will never get consensus but ...)
