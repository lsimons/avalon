                <p>
                    The Avalon Meta Model defines the functional structure
                    of component types and services. A Type definition contains 
                    information about deployment and runtime dependencies together 
                    with information about the services that a
                    component type can provide.
                </p>

            <subsection name="Meta Info Generation">
                <p>
                    Avalon provides a set of tools that automate the process 
                    of generating meta-info descriptors.  These tools provide
                    support for the generation of serializable and XML based
                    descriptors that are collocated with class files. Tool 
                    support is available for Ant and Maven.
                </p>

            <subsection name="Meta Model API/SPI">
                <p>
                    Type and service meta models are established as 
                    immutable objects that complement the classic information
                    available about a class.  Using the Type and Service 
                    descriptor classes, developers can be assured of greater
                    portability and interoperability of container-side applications.
