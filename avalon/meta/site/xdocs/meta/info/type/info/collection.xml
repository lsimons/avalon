        Declaration of a garbage collection policy default override.  If 
        the value is "weak" the component will be decommissioned automatically
        if all references to the component have been released.  If the value
        "soft" the component will be decommissioned in the event of 
        memory contention. If the value is "hard" the component will be 
        maintained for the life of its container.  If undefined, the default
        collection policy is "hard".
