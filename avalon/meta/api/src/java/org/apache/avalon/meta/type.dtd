   descriptor (XML) file format/syntax.

   An xinfo file is an XML file used to describe component types and is located side-by-side with
   the .class file of the component. It describes the services the component requires to operate
   (its dependecies), the services the component is capable of offerring other component, the 
   context entrys that component requires, logging catagories that the compoent may use, stage 
   depedencies, supplied extension haddlers, and management control points and other support meta 
   data in the form of attributes.

<!--
A type element is the document root, it defines:

info           the specific details about this component type
loggers        the loggers used by this component type
context        the context required by this component type
services       the services offered by this component type
dependencies   the services that this component type require to operate
stages         the lifecycle stage extensions that this component type is depenent on
extensions     the lifecycle extensions that this component type provides

-->

<!ELEMENT type ( info, loggers?, context?, services?, dependencies?, stages?, extensions?)>

<!--
The info element describes the component, it defines:

name	       the human readable name of component type. Must be a string
             containing alphanumeric characters, '.', '_' and starting
             with a letter.
version	     the version of the component in (in the format #.#.#, #.# or # where
             # is a integer
