Installing Merlin.
------------------

To use Merlin command line support or the Merlin NT Service
you will need to define the MERLIN_HOME environment
variable for your system and include MERLIN_HOME/bin in
your system path.  The MERLIN_HOME environment variable
should point to the merlin directory.

Under Windows you can set environment variables by selecting the 
Environment Tab from the System Control Panel.

Under Lunix you can do this as follows:

  $ echo '
  > # set location of merlin
  > export MERLIN_HOME=/opt/merlin
  > # include it in the path
  > export PATH=$PATH:$MERLIN_HOME/bin
  > ' >> ~/.bash_profile
  $ source ~/.bash_profile

Versions of Merlin prior to the 3.2-dev 20031210 build maintained 
a local repository of jar files under the %MERLIN_HOME%/repository
directory.  As of the 20031210 build the repository is maintained 
under AVALON_HOME which defaults to ${user.home}/.avalon.  To 
override this behaviour you can either define a AVALON_HOME 
environment variable or you can add a merlin.properties file to 
${user.home} containing the "merlin.repository" property key and 
a value point to you preferred repository location.

To confirm that your environment variables are correct, you
should open a new command window and invoke the Merlin
CLI application.

Under DOS:

  $ merlin -version

Under Lunix:

  $ merlin.sh -version

The installation of Merlin is now complete, however, two plugins are
provided with the installation supporting merlin development under the 
Maven platform.  These plugins should be placed in the Maven plugin 
directory (${maven.home.local}\plugins).

  [YOUR-MAVEN-HOME]\plugins\avalon-meta-plugin-1.2.jar
  [YOUR-MAVEN-HOME]\plugins\merlin-plugin-3.2.1-dev.jar

Please note that if you are upgrading an existing installation you must
delete the following two directories:

  [YOUR-MAVEN-HOME]\plugins\avalon-meta-plugin-*
  [YOUR-MAVEN-HOME]\plugins\merlin-plugin-* 

Replace the existing avalon-meta and merlin plugin jar files with the supplied
versions.  Finally, delete all *.cache files in the Maven plugin directory.

You now have everything in place to start using the Merlin Tutorial or 
building you own components.  If you have any problems, please subscribe
and post a message to users@avalon.apache.org.

Special Note for JRE 1.3 and earlier.
-------------------------------------

Some applications assume that XML parsing classes are available withing
the JRE.  This is not the case with JDK 1.3 and earlier.  To resolve this
you can copy the following files to the JAVAHOME/lib/ext directory or 
declare an alternative directory under the MERLIN_JVMARGS environment
variable.

  system/xml-apis/jars/xml-apis-2.0.2.jar
  system/xml-apis/jars/xmlParserAPIs-2.0.2.jar
  system/xerces/jars/xerces-2.4.0.jar
