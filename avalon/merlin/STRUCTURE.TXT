BUILD PROCEDURE:
----------------

The Merlin project requires the Maven project management tool. 
The merlin:install goal builds a Merlin installation directory under the 
default /target/merlin.

  $ maven merlin:install

Following the creation of an installation you need to declare the environment 
variable MERLIN_HOME with a value corresponding to the directory in which you
choose to deploy the merlin system.  Please also make sure that you include
MERLIN_HOME/bin in your PATH environment variable.  You can then move the merlin
directory to MERLIN_HOME following which the Merlin command line utilities 
should function properly.  You can confirm this (on NT) by opening a new DOS 
window and invoking the following command:

  $ merlin -version

Support for the installation and execution of Merlin as an NT process is 
now included in the package (refer bin directory) - special thanks to Leif
for helping to set this up.  When updating an existing installation, the 
maven goal merlin:update invokes the classic merlin:install and updates your local
merlin repository.  This is often convinient if you are frequently updating 
the merlin core.

For additional information please check the documentation and also use the 
Avalon Users list (subscription details in the doc).  The merlin:site goal 
aggregates the sources from across the main Merlin sub-projects to build a 
consolidated project presentation. The goal should be invoked from the 
root merlin directory.

  $ maven merlin:site

Finally, please keep in mind that while Merlin is nearing completion and 
readiness for a first release, it should be considered as beta software as 
APIs are changing, and documentation is evolving.
