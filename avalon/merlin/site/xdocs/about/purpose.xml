    <section name="Purpose">
      <subsection name="Simplification">
        <p>
Merlin aims to simplify the process of managing component-based systems.  It achieves this objective through delivery of functionality supporting automated component assembly and deployment.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Isolation">
        <p>
Merlin aims to provide a framework for isolating an application implementation from the service that the application provides. Applications are implemented through component composition. In turn, applications can be exposed as simple components and used by other components in building other applications.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Distribution">
        <p>
A goal of the Merlin project is to provide distribution of services established by system to other Merlin systems across a distributed network environment.
