    <section name="Runtime Management">

      <p>
Runtime management deals with interaction with a component between the incarnation and etherialization stages.  The Avalon framework defines the notion of a suspendable component.  The framework also defines a number of delivery interfaces dealing with reintroduction of lifecycle artificats. None of the framework reintroduction interfaces are supported - instead, runtime management is approached as a management concern wherein any existing artifact delivery interface may be reused by a container while a component is under a suspended state.  The action of resumption is equivalent to the notion of re-initialization.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Runtime Stage Table">

<p>
A component implementing the the <a href="http://avalon.apache.org/framework/api/org/apache/avalon/framework/activity/Suspendable.html">Suspendable</a> lifecycle may be suspended by a container management system. Following suspension a container may re-apply lifecycle artifact delivery stages (logging, contextualization, service, parameterization). 
</p>
<p><i>Suspendable Example:</i></p>
<source>
    /**
     * Suspend the component.
     */
     public void suspend()
     {
         ...
     }
</source>
            </td>

<p>
A component implementing the the <a href="http://avalon.apache.org/framework/api/org/apache/avalon/framework/activity/Suspendable.html">Suspendable</a> lifecycle may be placed back into operation following suspension by a container management system.

<p><i>Suspendable Example:</i></p>
<source>
    /**
     * Resume execution.
     */
     public void resume()
