      <subsection name="Declaring a configuration in the Component Directive">
        <p>
        We can modify the configuration behaviour by including a configuration 
        within the block.xml deployment directive.
        </p>
        <p>
        Resources supporting this tutorial are contained in the 
        tutorials/configuration/block directory.

     <component name="hello" class="tutorial.HelloComponent">
       <configuration>
         <source>explicit configuration within block</source>
       </configuration>

        <p>
        Build and run the tutorial again.

<source>
$ merlin -execute target\classes
</source>
        <p>
        In the logging output we see that the configuration
        supplied to the component has been overrided by the 
        information we supplied inside the &lt;component&gt;
        directive.

        <p>
        The <a href="defaults.html">next tutorial</a> shows how 
        Merlin provides support for the packaging of default 
        configurations with a component.
