      <subsection name="Creating a default configuration">
        <p>
        Merlin provides support for the association of a default
        with a component type.  This is achieved by including a 
        &lt;classname&gt;.xconfig resource co-located with the 
        component class.
        </p>
        <p>
        Resources supporting this tutorial are contained in the 
        tutorials/configuration/defaults/ directory.
        </p>

        <p><i>HelloComponent.xconfig</i></p>

<source><![CDATA[
<configuration>
  <source>packaged default</source>
</configuration>
]]></source>
        <p>
        Build and run the tutorial again.
        </p>
        <source>
$ merlin -execute target\classes
        </source>
        <p>
        In the logging output we see that the configuration
        supplied to the component has been overrided by the 
        information we supplied inside the xconfig resource.

      <subsection name="Using Target Overrides">

        <p>
        The <a href="override.html">next tutorial</a> shows how 
        you can modify configurations via declaration of a set 
        configuration override targets.  This is usefull when 
        you have a packaged deployment scenario and you want to 
        override/suppliment the configuration with different 
        information (such as host name, username, passwords, etc.).
