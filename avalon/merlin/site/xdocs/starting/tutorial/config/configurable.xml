      <subsection name="Adding configuration support to the component">
        <p>
        To be supplied with a configuration, our component must implement
        the Avalon Framework Configurable interface.  The following code
        is the HelloComponent extended to include implementation of 
        Configurable, and updates to the inialize method to log the source
        of the configuration based on runtime information.
        </p>
        <p>
        Resources supporting this tutorial are contained in the 
        tutorials/configuration/block/ directory.
        </p>
<source>
/**
 * A configurable component.
 *
 * @avalon.component version="1.0" name="simple"
 */
public class HelloComponent extends AbstractLogEnabled 
  implements Configurable, Initializable
{
    private String m_source = "undefined";

   /**

    * implementation get a child element named 'source' and 
    * assigns the value of the element to a local variable.
    *
    * @param config the component configuration
    * @exception ConfigurationException if a configuration error occurs
    */
    public void configure( Configuration config ) throws ConfigurationException
    {
        getLogger().info( "configuration stage" );
        m_source = config.getChild( "source" ).getValue( "unknown" );
    }

   /**
    * Initialization of the component by the container.
    * @exception Exception if an initialization error occurs

    public void initialize() throws Exception
    {
        getLogger().info( "initialization stage" );
        final String message =

        <p>
        A number of different approaches to controlling the configuration 
        that is supplied to a component are presented in the <a href="block.html">next 
        turorial</a>.
