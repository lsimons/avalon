      <subsection name="Building the Block">
        <p>
        Using the sources included in the tutorials/hello directory 
        you can build and run the example using the following commands:
        </p>
<source><![CDATA[
$ maven
]]></source>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Running the Block">
        <p>
To see Merlin in action, execute Merlin and give it either the 
jar file or the ${basedir}/target/classes directory as the deployment 
argument.  The following command deploys the component relative
to the compiled classes in the ${basedir}/target/classes directory.
        </p>
<source><![CDATA[
$ merlin -execute target\classes 
]]></source>

        <p>
Alternatively you can deploy the component from the jar file.
        </p>

<source><![CDATA[
$ merlin -execute target\merlin-hello-tutorial-1.0.jar
]]></source>

        <p>
        The output resulting from the execution of the block is as follows:
        </p>

<source><![CDATA[
[INFO   ] (tutorial.hello): logging
[INFO   ] (tutorial.hello): initialization
[INFO   ] (tutorial.hello): execution
[INFO   ] (tutorial.hello): disposal
]]></source>

        <p>
        Congratulations! You have build and deployed your first block.
        </p>
   
        <p>
        A quick look at some of the behind the scenes activity is 
        presented in the <a href="internal.html">next tutorial</a>.
