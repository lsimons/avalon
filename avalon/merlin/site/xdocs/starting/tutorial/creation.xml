      <subsection name="Tutorial Overview">
        <p>
        This tutorial takes you though the creation of a very simple
        component, the declaration of a component type descriptor, and the 
        declaration of a block containing the component.
        </p>
        <p>
        Resources (sample code and build files) supporting this tutorial 
        are included in the Merlin distribution under the tutorials/hello
        directory.

      <subsection name="Creating a component">
        <p>
           The following code is a minimal component.  It simply log a 
           message during the initialization stage.  We will progressively 
           extend this component to do more creative things as we proceed 
           through this tutorial.

      <subsection name="Creating a Type Descriptor">
      
        <p>
        In order for Merlin to recognize this class as a component, we need to 
        generate a &lt;classname&gt;.xinfo file. </p>
        <p>
        The following text
        is an example of a component type definition.  It contains the declaration
        of the component name and the component implementation version. It was 
        generated automatically for us by the pre-goal included in the maven.xml
        file.  The avalon:meta plugin looks for @avalon.component tags at class level
        and generates component descriptors for us automatically.
        </p>

    <name>hello</name>

      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Creating a block">
        <p>
A block is the definition of a composite component. It represents an application made up of a set of components and the supporting resources.  In our example the block will contain the single HelloComponent component.  Based on this information Merlin will create a container and deploy the hello component on startup.
