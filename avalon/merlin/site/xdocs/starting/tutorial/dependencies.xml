    <section name="Using Merlin">
      <subsection name="Managing Dependencies">
        <p>
        A component type can declare dependencies on services provided by 
        other components.  Merlin will ensure that dependencies are resolved
        prior to creation of the dependent component.  Dependencies are 
        declared in the component xinfo resource and supplied by Merlin to
        the component using the Avalon Serviceable interface.
        </p>
        <p>
        Resource supporting this tutorial are contained in the 
        turorials/dependencies package.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Adding a Serviceable method implementation">
        <p>
        The following code fragment is the implementation of the 
        Serviceable interface under the HelloComponent.java source. 
        </p>
        <p><i>
        Note the use of the @avalon.dependency tag. 
        </i></p>
        <p><i>HelloComponent.java</i></p>
<source>
package tutorial;

import org.apache.avalon.framework.logger.AbstractLogEnabled;

    * @avalon.dependency type="tutorial.RandomGenerator:1.0"
    *    key="random"
    */
    public void service( ServiceManager manager )
      throws ServiceException
    {
        m_random = (RandomGenerator) manager.lookup( "random" );
    }

    public void initialize()
    {
        getLogger().info( "initialization" );
        getLogger().info( "received random value: " + m_random.getRandom() );
    }

    public void dispose()
    {
        getLogger().info( "disposal" );
    }
}

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Declaring the service dependency">
        <p>
        In this example we are automatically generating the xinfo descriptors
        using the builtin meta-info generation goal based on the presence of
        dependency tag.
        </p>
<source><![CDATA[
* @avalon.dependency type="tutorial.RandomGenerator:1.0"
*    key="random"
]]></source>

        <p>
        The generated xinfo for the hello component is shown below.

      <subsection name="Executing the demo">
        <p>
        Build and run the tutorial.

        <source>
$ maven
$ merlin target\classes -execute
        </source>
        <p>
        In the logging output we see that Merlin has automatically
        locating the RandomGeneratorProvider and associated it as
        the source for the RandomGenerator service.  The HelloComponent
        implementation has logged the result of accessing and using 
        the service.

      <subsection name="Advanced Features">
        <p>
        This completes the introduction to some of the basic features
        of the merlin platform.  More tutorials will be added so please check 
        for new releases and updates. In the meantime you may want to take a 
        look at some of Merlin's more <a href="../advanced/index.html">advanced 
        features</a>.
