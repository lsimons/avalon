      <subsection name="Build Procedure">

        <p>
        After downloading the Merlin 3.2 binary distribution and 
        inpacking the archive into you preferred location, you should
        have a directory structure that looks like the following: 
        </p>
<source><![CDATA[
  /merlin
    /bin
    /config
    /ext
    /system
    README.TXT
    LICENSE.TXT
  /plugins
    avalon-meta-plugin-1.3.1.jar
    merlin-plugin-3.2.3.jar
]]></source>

        <p>
To use Merlin command line support or the Merlin NT Service
you will need to define the MERLIN_HOME environment
variable for your system and include MERLIN_HOME/bin in
your system path.  The MERLIN_HOME environment variable
should point to the merlin directory.
        </p>

        <p>
Under Lunix you can do this as follows:
        </p>

<source><![CDATA[
  $ echo '
  > # set location of merlin
  > export MERLIN_HOME=/opt/merlin
  > # include it in the path
  > export PATH=$PATH:$MERLIN_HOME/bin
  > ' >> ~/.bash_profile
  $ source ~/.bash_profile
]]></source>

        <p>
Under Windows you can set environment variables by selecting the 
Environment Tab from the System Control Panel.
        </p>
        <p>
Versions of Merlin prior to the 3.2-dev 20031210 build maintained 
a local repository of jar files under the %MERLIN_HOME%/repository
directory.  As of the 20031210 build the repository is maintained 
under AVALON_HOME which defaults to ${user.home}/.avalon.  To 
override this behaviour you can either define a AVALON_HOME 
environment variable or you can add a merlin.properties file to 
${user.home} containing the "merlin.repository" property key and 
a value point to you preferred repository location.
        </p>
        <p>
To confirm that your environment variables are correct, you
should open a new command window and invoke the Merlin
CLI application.
        </p>

Under DOS:

  $ merlin -version

Under Lunix:

  $ merlin.sh -version

]]></source>
        <p>
The installation of Merlin is now complete, however, two plugins are
provided with the installation supporting merlin development under the 
Maven platform.  These plugins should be placed in the Maven plugin 
directory (%MAVEN_HOME%\plugins).
        </p>
<source><![CDATA[
  %MAVEN_HOME%\plugins\avalon-meta-plugin-1.3.1.jar
  %MAVEN_HOME%\plugins\merlin-plugin-3.2.3.jar
]]></source>

Please note that if you are upgrading an existing installation you must
delete the following two directories:

      <subsection name="Validating your installation.">

        <p>
          The following instructions assume that you have defined the
          MERLIN_HOME environment variable that points the directory
          containing the Merlin installation.
        </p>

        <p>
          To confirm that you MERLIN_HOME variable is correct, you
          should open a new command line window and invoke the Merlin
          CLI application. The following command should list the
          Merlin CLI help information.
        </p>

<source><![CDATA[
$ merlin.sh -help
usage: merlin [block] [-lang <code>] [-install <url>] 
  [-library <directory>] [-help] [-version] [-home <directory>] 
  [-impl <artifact>] [-debug] [-info] [-config <url>] 
  [-context <directory>] [-system <directory>] [-execute]

        <p>
          Now that you have installed Merlin on your system you can
          proceed to the <a href="./../../tutorial/index.html">Using Merlin</a>
          tutorial page.
