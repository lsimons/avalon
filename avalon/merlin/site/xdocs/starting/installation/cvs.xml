            <subsection name="Checkout">

                <p>
                    To build the Merlin installation you need to checkout the
                    Merlin project from CVS. The commands in this document
                    assume a unix-style system; the procedure under windows is
                    similar, and identical if you have <a
                    href="http://www.cygwin.com">cygwin</a> installed.
                </p>

            <subsection name="Build">

                <p>
                    Once checkout is complete you can build Merlin using <a
                    href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> as follows:
                </p>

<source><![CDATA[
$ cd avalon/meta
$ maven
$ cd ../util
$ maven
$ cd ../repository
$ maven
$ cd ../merlin
$ maven
]]></source>

                <p>
                    The above build procedure will create a installation
                    directory containing the Merlin system at
                </p>

<source><![CDATA[
+-- avalon
  +-- merlin
    +-- target
      +-- merlin
]]></source>

            <subsection name="Replicate">
                <p>
                    Copy the 'merlin' directory to your preferred location
                    installation location. For example, you may want to copy
                    the installation dir to the /opt dir:
                </p>

<source><![CDATA[
$ cp -Rf merlin/target/merlin /opt/merlin
]]></source>

                <p>
                    Continue with the <a href="install.3.3.html">binary install</a> 
                    instructions concerning the setup of environment variables to 
                    complete your installation.
