        <p>
        The Merlin platform provides an abstract test case class that you
        can use as a component factory.  To create a Merlin based unit
        test you simply extend AbstractMerlinTestCase.
        </p>
        <p>
        To use AbstractMerlinTestCase you should include the following 
        dependency in you maven project definition.
        </p>
<source><![CDATA[
    <dependency>
      <groupId>merlin</groupId>
      <artifactId>merlin-unit</artifactId>
      <version>3.2.5-dev</version>
    </dependency>
]]></source>
        <p>
        The following code fragment declares a new test case using the 
        abstract Merlin test case.
        </p>
        <source>
import org.apache.avalon.merlin.unit.AbstractMerlinTestCase;

public class ExampleTestCase extends AbstractMerlinTestCase
{
    public ExampleTestCase( String name )
    {
        super( name );
    }

    // ...
}
        </source>
        <p>
        The default behaviour is to deploy a block based on the 
        deployment path ${basedir}/target/classes/.  Merlin will attempt
        to locate a block.xml file at the [DEPLOYMENT-PATH]/BLOCK-INF/block.xml. 
        To make sure that a block.xml file and component meta-info is available under 
        ${basedir}/target/classes/ you need to include the following resource
        statement in you maven project descriptor.
        </p>
<source><![CDATA[
  <build>
    <sourceDirectory>${basedir}/src/java/</sourceDirectory>
    <unitTestSourceDirectory>${basedir}/src/test/</unitTestSourceDirectory>
    <resources>
      <resource>
        <directory>${basedir}/conf</directory>
        <targetPath>BLOCK-INF</targetPath>
        <includes>
          <include>block.xml</include>
        </includes>
      </resource>
      <resource>
        <directory>${basedir}/src/java</directory>
        <includes>
          <include>**/*.x*</include>
        </includes>
      </resource>
    </resources>
  </build>
]]></source>

        <p>
        You can now access components established by Merlin via 
        the component path.  For example, if your block.xml defines
        a component named "hello" in a container named "test" you 
        access the component by requesting the path "/test/hello".  
        </p>
        <p>
        The following code fragment demonstrates the usage of the 
        resolve method to locate a named component.
        </p>
<source><![CDATA[
public void testServiceResolution() throws Exception
{
    Hello hello = (Hello) resolve( "/test/hello" );
    assertNotHull( "hello", hello );
}
]]></source>

      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Customizing Merlin behaviour">
        <p>
        You can customize all of the deployment and runtime parameters
        of the embedded merlin instance by adding a "merlin.properties"
        file to your basedir.
        </p>
        <p>
        <i>Example merlin.properties</i>
        </p>
<source><![CDATA[
merlin.info = true
merlin.debug = true
merlin.override = conf/config.xml
