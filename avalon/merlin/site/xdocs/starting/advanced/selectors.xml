      <subsection name="Profile Selection">
        <p>
In the <a href="profiles.html">Profile tutorial</a> we covered the mechanisms used to establish a set of pre-configured deployment profiles.  Generally speaking the combination of profile overriding in the block.xml &lt;component&gt; directive, packaged profiles, and default configurations is sufficient.  However, mechanisms are provided for the introduction of profile selection policy.  In this tutorial we include multiple deployment profiles to the random generator component and we define a custom profile selector.  The selector is declared to Merlin as an attribute of the dependency declared by the consuming component (HelloComponent). 
        </p>
        <p>
Component deployment profiles are co-located with the component implementation class under an .xprofile resource.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Adding multiple profiles">
        <p>
          The RandomGeneratorProvider.xprofile is updated to include 
          multiple profiles.

      <subsection name="Creating a ProfileSelector">
        <p>
          A ProfileSelector may be declared to Merlin as part of a dependency
          declaration.  The following code is an implementation of a profile

      <subsection name="Associating the selector with a dependency">
        <p>
          A custom selector is declared under the dependent component. This is 
          achieved by declaring the "urn:avalon:profile.selector" attribute
          with a value corresponding to the classname of the selector.
