      <subsection name="Profile Selection">
        <p>
In the <a href="profiles.html">Profile tutorial</a> we covered the mechanisms used to establish a pre-configured deployment profile. In this tutorial we update the &lt;classname&gt;.xprofile to include multiple named profiles and show how you can select a specific profile when declaring a component in block descriptor.
        </p>
        <p>
Component deployment profiles are co-located with the component implementation class under an .xprofile resource.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Adding multiple profiles">
        <p>
          The RandomGeneratorProvider.xprofile is updated to include 
          multiple profiles.  
        </p>
        <p><i>RandomGeneratorProvider.xprofile</i></p>
<source><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<profiles>

  <profile name="primary">
    <configuration>
      <seed>1024</seed>
    </configuration>
  </profile>

  <profile name="secondary">
    <configuration>
      <seed>2048</seed>
    </configuration>
  </profile>

</profiles>
]]></source>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Component declaration using a named profile">
        <p>
          A &lt;component&gt; element may contain the <strong>profile</strong>
          attribute.  The value of the profile attribute is the name of a 
          profile declared under the .xprofile resource.  If a component 
          directive uses the profile attribute content of the element will     
          be ignored.
        </p>

   <component name="randomizer" 
     class="tutorial.RandomGeneratorProvider" 
     profile="secondary"/>
]]></source>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Executing the tutorial">
        <p>
        Build and run the tutorial.
        </p>
        <source>
$ maven jar
$ merlin -execute target\classes
        </source>
        <p>
In the logging output we see that Merlin has selected the "secondary" profile and as a consequence the random seed declared in the secondary profile is different to our earlier examples.
