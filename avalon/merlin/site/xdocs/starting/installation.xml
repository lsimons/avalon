            <subsection name="Build Procedure">

                <p>
                    To build the Merlin installation you need to checkout the
                    Merlin project from CVS. The commands in this document
                    assume a unix-style system; the procedure under windows is
                    similar, and identical if you have <a
                    href="http://www.cygwin.com">cygwin</a> installed.
                </p>
<source><![CDATA[
$ cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic login
$ cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic co avalon-sandbox/merlin/
]]></source>

                <p>
                    Once checkout is complete you can build Merlin using <a
                    href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> as follows:
                </p>

<source><![CDATA[
$ cd avalon-sandbox/merlin
$ maven merlin-dist
]]></source>

                <p>
                    The above build procedure will create a installation
                    directory containing the Merlin system at
                </p>

            <subsection name="Copy the merlin directory to your preferred location.">
                <p>
                    Copy the 'merlin' directory to your preferred location
                    installation location. For example, you may want to copy
                    the installation dir to the /opt dir:
                </p>

<source><![CDATA[
$ cp -Rf merlin/target/merlin /opt/merlin-SNAPSHOT
$ ln -s /opt/merlin-SNAPSHOT /opt/merlin
]]></source>

            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Declare MERLIN_HOME environment variable">

                <p>
                    To use Merlin command line support or the Merlin NT Service
                    you will need to define the MERLIN_HOME environment
                    variable for your system and include MERLIN_HOME/bin in
                    your system path:
                </p>

<source><![CDATA[
$ echo '
> # set location of merlin
> export MERLIN_HOME=/opt/merlin
> # include it in the path
> export PATH=$PATH:$MERLIN_HOME/bin
> ' >> ~/.bash_profile
$ source ~/.bash_profile
]]></source>

            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Validating your installation.">

                <p>
                    The following instructions assume that you have defined the
                    MERLIN_HOME environment variable that points the directory
                    containing the Merlin installation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To confirm that you MERLIN_HOME variable is correct, you
                    should open a new command line window and invoke the Merlin
                    CLI application. The following command should list the
                    Merlin CLI help information.
                </p>

$ merlin.sh -help

            <subsection name="Next Steps">
                <p>
                    Now that you have installed Merlin on your system you can
                    proceed to the <a href="./tutorial/index.html">Using Merlin</a>
                    tutorial page.
