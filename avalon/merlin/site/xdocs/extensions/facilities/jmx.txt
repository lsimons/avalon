    <section name="JMX Extension">
      <p>
        <strong>Status: Under Development</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Since: Merlin 3.4</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Merlin JMX Extension is an MX4J adapter and contains everything 
        needed to expose components as MBeans, as well as the JMX Agent and
        a couple of connectors, such as the HttpConnector and Remote JMX
        connector (JSR-160).
      </p>
      <p>
        To enable JMX, you will need to declare the JMX Facility, as well as
        enable the components to be MBeans. See the example below on how to
        enable the JMX Facility. To enable the components to become MBeans,
        you have a few ways to do so;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Create a management interface which the component implements and
          declare the <code>@avalon.mx interface="com.mydomain.MyMxInterface"</code>
          in the component.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a MBeanInfo class.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section name="Example" >
      <subsection name="Enabling the JMX Agent" >
        <p>
          This is done by including the JMX Agent block, typically in your 
          top level block.xml.
