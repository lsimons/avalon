      <subsection name="Entry Tag">
<p>The entry tag declares a context entry required by a component.  The component is supplied the context entry via a context argument as part of the contextualization lifecycle stage. Context entries my declare a object type or array of object types.  If the type is not declared java.lang.String is assumed.  Context entries may be declared as option.  The default behaviour is to assume that a context entry is required.</p>
