Meta information associated with component types can be expressed directly in XML or documented in javadoc tags within the component source code.  The javadoc tag approach ensures that specifications are maintain with respective sources.  Generation of meta info is achieved through a meta-info generation tool.  Tools are provided for both Ant and Maven.
