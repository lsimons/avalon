      <subsection name="Version Tag">
<p>A version tag may be declared in either a class or interface.  It specifices the version of the component or service (depeding if the tag is included within a class or interface).  The presence of a version tag signals to the generation tools that a meta-info description is required.  In the case of a class, a Type defintion is created whereas an version tag in an interface will result in the generation of a Service descriptor.</p>
