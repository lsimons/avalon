        <p>
          Parameters have been introduced to allow for the internals of the
          kernel to be tuned for different purposes. Initially, the number
          parameters available is fairly small, but we expect this number to
          grow steadily.

            <td>
              The time in millisecond within which the deployment of any 
              component and any container must complete. Once this time
              limit has been reached, the deployment system will try to
              interrupt() the thread. If that succeeds, the deployment
              the container will fail, but other containers may still be
              deployed. If the interrupt() fails, the whole JVM must be
              considered unstable, and should terminate.

              This is a global switch for turning the code level security
              on or off. For compatibility reasons, the default is false, 
              but any production system should have this true. In the
              kernel.xml it is set to true, and for the debug.xml it is
              set to false.
