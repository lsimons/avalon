    <section name="Logging Category Directives">
<p>Component scoped logging directives are relative to the enclosing component profile declaration.  The logging categories are component specific and will normally be documented as part of the component you are using.  The following example is the logging configuration for the demonstration component included with the distribution.</p>

<source>

<p><font color="gray"><i>&lt;!-- A classpath declaration could be included here or under the container scope. --&gt;</i></font></p>
    &lt;container name="<font color="darkred">root</font>"&gt;
</source>
    <font color="gray"><i>&lt;!-- 
    Component profile declaration.
    --&gt;</i></font>
<source>
     &lt;component name="<font color="darkred">complex</font>" 
       class="<font color="darkred">org.apache.excalibur.playground.ComplexComponent</font>" 
       activation="<font color="darkred">true</font>"&gt;
</source>
    <p><font color="gray"><i>&lt;!-- 
Multiple categories may be declared - each category defines a priority and target to be used for the respective caegory.  Category names are scoped relative to the component.  As such a category name of "init" translates to a full logging category path of &lt;container-path&gt;root.init.  The logging element may contain priority and target attribute values.  These values will overide the container wide defaults. --&gt;</i></font>
    </p>

<source>
       &lt;categories priority="<font color="darkred">DEBUG</font>"&gt;
         &lt;category name="<font color="darkred">init</font>" priority="<font color="darkred">WARN</font>"/&gt;
       &lt;/categories&gt;
     &lt;/component&gt;
</source>

<p><font color="gray"><i>&lt;!-- Other container declarations. --&gt;</i></font></p>
