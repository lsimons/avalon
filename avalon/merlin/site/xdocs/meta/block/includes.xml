            of the containing block. Is useful as alternative form to the "id"
            model during development. If the "path" attribute is declared, the 
            id and version attribute will be ignored.

        NOTE: It is an error the include directive does not container one of 
        two possible include forms ("path" or "id").

      <subsection name="Description">
<p>An include directive instructs Merlin to load and deploy the block defined within the referenced jar file as a subcontainer within the enclosing container.  The include directive is equivalent to the nesting of a full block definition within another block.  Block includes enable composition of pre-packaged component based solutions as the included block appears to other components as a regual component (exposing services and dependecies, etc.).</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Sample XML">
<p>
The following example block.xml demonstrates the inclusion of three blocks within another enclosing block.  In this example, the common shared API (containing service interfaces classes is declared in the containing block classloader).
