        Merlin is an implementation of a component management platform. 
        CCM is the CORBA Component Model specification.  The following table
        compares CCM notions with the corresponding notions within Merlin.

        General notes concerning the feasibility of supporting CCM are detailed below.

          <tr>
            <td>navigation</td>
            <td>
        CCM provides a mechanisms support service navigation.  In CCM terms this 
        corresponds to the ability of a client to navigate from a Facet (service)
        to other facets exposed by the componet equivalent interface. This functionality
        can be viewed as a "inversion of control" issue, however in practive it is 
        equivalent to the exposure of a service along with the ability to allow a client
        to navigate to other services exposed by the same component type.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>connection</td>
            <td>
        A connection is defined in CCM as operations on a component which is consitent 
        with a type dependency declaration.  A CCM component generated from a Type would
        expose operations supporting connection and disconnection relative to named 
        connection roles.
