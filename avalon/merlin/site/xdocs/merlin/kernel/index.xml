    <p>
      Merlin separates the concepts of <strong>Kernel</strong> and 
      <strong>Container</strong>. A kernel manages <em>resources</em> (Objects)
      whereas a container manages <em>services</em>. Merlin provides a default 
      kernel that manages a container hierarchy: <a 
      href="../../api/org/apache/avalon/merlin/impl/DefaultKernel.html">
      DefaultKernel</a>. It handles overall management, including startup, 
      shutdown, extension management, and other system-wide tasks.
    </p>

    <p>
      The kernel provides a set of bootstrap services (like a logging service) 
      and context entries to the (root) container it is managing. It 
      subsequently publishes established entries and services (derived from 
      container deployment) towards kernel clients.
