    <section name="Merlin CLI (Command Line Interface)">
      <subsection name="Overview">
      <p>
Merlin CLI is the command line interface to the Merlin system. It provides support for the declaration of the root block directive, a working home directory, a kernel directive, and other parameters qualifying debug output and language policy.
      </p>
      <p>
The prime objective the Merlin CLI is to launch a root block descriptor and facilitate the deployment of the block and as a consequence, the deployment of subsidiary blocks, containers and components.
      </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Command Line">
        <p>
The Merlin CLI takes a [block] filename as it's primary argument.  The block may be a block XML file or a jar file containing a block directive.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>
Example of block deployment based on a supplied block directive.
