    <p>
The Merlin Kernel is designed first and foremost as an embeddable 
container.  The 3.2 release introduced several improvements to the 
embedding strategy through leverage of the avalon-repository 
boostrapping system, and added comprehensive support for the 
management of properties anabling complete configuration of a new
kernel instance programatically or via property resolution.
