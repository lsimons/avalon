      <p>
Merlin 3.2 introduces a complete property configuration model as part of the unification of the embedding strategy. Merlin properties are included in a file named "merlin.properties".  Merlin will look for this file in the following locations:
      </p>
        <table>
          <tr><th>Location</th><th>Description</th></tr>
          <tr>
            <td>${merlin.dir}/merlin.properties</td>
            <td>This is equivalent to the ${user.dir} location unless 
              modified by the command line -home command parameter.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>${user.home}/merlin.properties</td>
            <td>The user's home directory.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>${merlin.home}/merlin.properties</td>
            <td>The merlin installation directory.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Bootstrap Properties">
        <p>
         The following properties are established by Merlin during the 
         bootstrap phase and cannot be override.
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr><th>Property</th><th>Default Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
          <tr>
            <td>merlin.dir</td>
            <td>${user.dir}</td>
            <td>The working directory used by Merlin.  This value defaults to 
             ${user.dir} under normal circumstances.  If a System property
             of ${basedir} is present it will be assigned as ${merlin.dir}.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>merlin.implementation</td>
            <td>declared under package merlin.properties resource</td>

        supported by Merlin as of 3.2.
