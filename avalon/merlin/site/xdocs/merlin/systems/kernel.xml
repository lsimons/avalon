      <p>
      The kernel represents the root object within a merlin system.
      It provides access to a root container and exposes operations 
      enabling system startup and shutdown. The kernel is created 
      using a kernel factory (see <a href="../embedding/index.html">embedding</a>). 
      </p>

          <td>
          The kernel provides support for generic embedding within 
          diverse application scenarios.  In all cases the the approach 
          to embedding leverages a kernal factory that can be parameterized
          to suite the particular embedding scenario.

          <td>Model Access</td>
          <td>
          The kernel provides application programmers with access to the 
          root containment model, enabling dynamic addition and removal 
          of deployment models.
