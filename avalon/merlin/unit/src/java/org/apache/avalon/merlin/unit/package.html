<p>
The unit package is an extended UnitTest class that handles the establishment of 
a Merlin Kernel using the target/classes as the primary deployment path.  The 
unit test builds and deploys the container and provides convinient access to 
services via component paths.
</p>
<h3>Usage Example</h3>
<p>The package include the class AbstractMerlinTestCase.  To create a new test
case including the Merlin service handling simply extend AbstractMerlinTestCase.</p>
<pre>
  public class SampleTestCase extends AbstractMerlinTestCase
  {
      public void testSomething()
      {
          // resolve a service established by Merlin
          Hello hello = resolve( "hello" );

          // do some tests against the Hello service
          assetTrue( hello.getMessage().equals( "Hello" ) );
      }
  }
</pre>
<p>In the above example the abstract testcase is establishing a merlin kernel and 
loading a container relative to the default deployment path ${basedir}/target/classes.
You can override default behaviour by using constructor arguments to qualify an 
alternative deployment path, info, and debugging policies.</p>
