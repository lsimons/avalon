        <name>avalon-artifact:install</name>
        <description>
          This goal is automatically invoked.
          The goal calls the avalon-artifact:create followed by a copy
          of the ${pom.artifactId}-${pom.currentVersion}.jar.meta to the 
          local repository.

      <goal>
        <name>avalon-artifact:create</name>
        <description>
          This goal will create the extra 
          ${pom.artifactId}-${pom.currentVersion}.jar.meta file required by
          Merlin to handle automatic dependency resolution on artifacts stored
          in central and local repositories.
