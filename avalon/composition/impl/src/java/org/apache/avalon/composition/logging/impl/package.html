<p>The <code>logging</code> package contains the
{@link org.apache.avalon.composition.logging.impl.DefaultLoggingManager} which
is an initial bootstrap logging mananager that uses mata information
about logging targets and catagories.  This class is subject to
refactoring to bring in into a component model to enable easy
specialization and/or replacement.</p>
