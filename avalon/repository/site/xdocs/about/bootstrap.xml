          <p>
          A bootstap deliverable jar file is provided as part of the Avalon
          Repository distribution.  This deliverable includes the API, SPI 
          and a micro-bootstrap repository that is used to load different 
          repository implementations.  The bootstrap system provides added 
          features dealing with application deployment, including classloader
          chain establishment and application instantiation.
          </p>
          <p>
          A bootstrap profile is established relative to the following 
          environment variables and properties:
          </p>
          <table>
            <tr><th>Location</th></tr>

            <td>${avalon.home}</td>
            <td>The default cache. In undefined in a property file, the value
             defaults to an equivalent system property and if underfined, will 
             attempt to locate an environment variable AVALON_HOME.  If the env 
             variable is not declared the default repository directory will 
             revert to ${user.home}/.avalon.</td>
