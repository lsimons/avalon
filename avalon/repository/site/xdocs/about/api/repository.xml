          The <a href="../../api/org/apache/avalon/repository/Repository.html">Repository</a> 
          interface provides a simple protocol independent API against which a client can 
          retrieve physical artifacts, artifact metadata, and composite objects derived from 
          metadata information.

        <subsection name="Get an artifact.">
          <p>The getResource( Artifact artifact ) operation provides a simple
          protocol independent method to get a concrete url to a resource.  The 
          actual url returned to the client is a function of the repository 
          implementation established at runtime.</p>

                <p>The getAttributes operation provides support for 
                the retrival of a set of attributes corresponding to 
                metadata about an artifact. This information is used 
                to construct higher level objecets such as classloaders
                based on dependencies declaring in metadata.</p>

     * its dependencies are used to construct the ClassLoaders.

                operation except that it allows the declaration of the parent 
                classloader to be used when constructing the new classloader
