    <section name="Avalon Repository - Installation">

      <p>
        The repository facility is available as a binary downaload 
        or can be built from CVS.  The following instructions deal with 
        CVS related builds.
      </p>
      <subsection name="CVS Install">
        <p>
          To build the repository facility you need to checkout the
          Merlin project from CVS. The commands in this document
          assume a unix-style system; the procedure under windows is
          similar, and identical if you have <a
          href="http://www.cygwin.com">cygwin</a> installed.
        </p>
<source><![CDATA[
$ cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic login
$ cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic co avalon/util
$ cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic co avalon/repository
]]></source>
        <p>
          Once checkout is complete you can build Merlin using <a
          href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> as follows:
        </p>
<source><![CDATA[
$ cd avalon/util
$ maven
$ cd ../repository
$ maven
]]></source>
