Meta Generation
---------------

This tutorial demonstrates the creation of meta-info tags and subsequent deployment of a container using the component types declared with the meta.

$ maven clean
$ maven

The maven run will build and deploy the resulting component model.
During deployment you should see the following log messages.

[INFO   ] (primary): ready
[INFO   ] (secondary): logging established
[INFO   ] (secondary.system): primary service resolved
