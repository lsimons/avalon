    <title>Avalon Logging - Multicast Log Target</title>

        <p>
          The multicast target is a target that handles the redirection
          of a logging event to one or more log targets. This target is 
          typically used in conjuction with different filters to control
          and qualify the information presented to different targets.  
          For example, an application may configure a console target with 
          summary warning and error reports to console, and a detailed 
          error log with full stack trace to a rotating file target.
          The multiplex target enabled the declaration of a single logical
          target and the subsequent formatting and generation of log message
          appropriate for the relative targets.
