      <subsection name="Implementation Model">
        <p>
        The Avalon Logging system is defined by an API.  This API declares
        a set of interfaces for use by plugable implementations.  Currently
        we have one default plugable implementation which is based on the 
        Avalon LogKit solution.

            <td>
            The Avalon LogKit plugin provides support for four standard log 
            targets.  These include a rotating file target, a console target, 
            a multiplex target, and a plugin target.  The plugin target provides
            support for the dynamic loading of new targets based on a artifact
            identifier.

            <td>
              The Log4J plugin is a very thin wrapper of the extensive
              Log4J Logging subsystem. Since Log4J's configuration is 
              used as-is, all configurable features are supported.
              For more information about Log4J
              and how it is configured, please visit the
              <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/">Log4J project</a>.
