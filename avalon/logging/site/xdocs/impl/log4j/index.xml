    <section name="Avalon Log4J Logging Plugin">
      <subsection name="Overview">
        <p>
          The Log4J plugin for Avalon Logging allows for the usage of
          Apache Log4J log system to be driving your Avalon application.
          It is a very thin wrapper to Log4J, introducing a single extra
          method call (non reflected) for the log output methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of mixing in the Log4J configuration into the rest
          of Avalon configuration files, they remain external and
          are instead referenced. Both XML and Properties files are
          supported, and by giving an optional <strong>update</strong>
          element, the configureAndWatch() method will be used.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>NOTE! </strong> &quot;Base Directory&quot;
          (property &quot;avalon.logging.basedir&quot;) is NOT SUPPORTED, and
          all relative filenames inside the Log4J configuration will
          relative to <strong>user.dir</strong> (current directory).
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="XML Specification">
        <table>
          <tr><th>Nested Element</th><th>Description</th></tr>
          <tr>
            <td>src</td>
            <td>
              The filename or URL of the Log4J configuration file. This
              file can either be an XML or a Properties configuration file,
              but MUST end with <strong>&quot;.xml&quot;</strong> if it is
              the former.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>update</td>
            <td>
              The Update Interval. For files, unlike URLs, it is 
              possible for Log4J to check for the file being modified
              externally, and if so reload the configuration. If this
              element is specified and has a positive value, this
              FileWatch feature of Log4J will be used. The time is
              specified in milliseconds.
            </td>
