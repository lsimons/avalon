      <subsection name="Logkit Configuration Example">
        <p>
        The following is an example of a LogKit configuration. The example
        establishes three target, a file target, a console stream target, 
        and a multicast target.  Logging events are assigned to the multicast 
        target resulting in event delivery to both the file and console. The
        formats of the respective targets are selected for the relative roles.
        The file target handles full reporting with stack trace information. 
        The console target handles a more consolidated error reporting scheme.
