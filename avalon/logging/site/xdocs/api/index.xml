      <subsection name="Logging System API">
        <p>
        The logging API is divided into two sections - one dealing with 
        meta data directives, and the second dealing with the logging
        system service interface.  The logging metadata addresses the 
        desription of a logging channel by a client.  The description is 
        encapsulated in the 
        <a href="api/org/apache/avalon/logging/data/CategoriesDirective.html">
        CategoriesDirective</a> and 
        <a href="api/org/apache/avalon/logging/data/CategoryDirective.html">
        CategoryDirective</a> immutable directives.
        </p>
        <p>
        Category directives describe the logging channel requirements, 
        including channel name, priority, and a named logging target.
        </p>
        <p>
        A logging manager is responsible for fulling the the requirements 
        expressed by a caregory directive.  This capability is defined by the 
        <a href="api/org/apache/avalon/logging/provider/LoggingManager.html">
        LoggingManager</a> interface.  Implementations such as the 
        <a href="api/org/apache/org/avalon/logging/logkit/DefaultLoggingFactory.html">LogKit</a>
        factory plugin are established via the avalon repository system.
