The avalon-logging package is a open logging platform suitable for 
use by container implementators. It is based largely on the original
excalibur logging system but with some important changes.  Firstly 
it leverages the avalon-repository technology to support dynamic 
loading of implementation strategies, secondly, it simplies the
overall approach to target configuration, and thirdly, it applies
a formal logging category meta-data model that is consitent with 
model-driven container solutions.

Please note that this package has not been released.
