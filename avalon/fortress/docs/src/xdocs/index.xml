    <section><title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
        Fortress contains a framework to help you create your own
        avalon containers.  It boasts asynchronous management of your
        component instances, high scalability, easier maintenance of
        your code, and easy embedding into various environments like
        servlet engines.

    <section><title>Downloads</title>
        <p>
            When fortress is released, binaries will be made available. For
            now, you can try downloading a nightly build from
            <link href="http://cvs.apache.org/builds/avalon/nightly/">here</link>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other than that, the only way to get fortress is by using cvs.

        <ul>
            <li>The primary source of documentation is the fortress website, available
            at
            <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/avalon/fortress/">http://jakarta.apache.org/avalon/fortress/</link>.</li>
            <li>There is some material relating to fortress in the experimental
            <link href="http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/">ApacheWiki</link>, right
            <link href="http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?AvalonFortress">here</link>.
            One of the things you can find there is the
            <link href="http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?AvalonFortressFAQ">FAQ</link>.</li>
            <li>You will probably want to check out the examples that come with fortress;
            they're located in the examples/ dir in cvs, and nightly builds are also
            made available.</li>
            <li>For general information about the avalon project, you will want to read the
            <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/avalon/framework/">Avalon Framework Documentation</link>.
            <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/avalon/developing/">Developing with Avalon</link> is a
            terribly useful resource as well.</li>
            <li>We strive to completely javadoc all source code; the apidocs are available
            <link href="api/">online</link>.</li>
            <li>If, after reading all that, you still have unanswered questions, the
            <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/mail2.html#Avalon">avalon-user list</link>
            and its archive can be incredibly useful.</li>
        </ul>
