    <title>Avalon Utilities - Defaults</title>
  </properties>
  <body>
    <section name="Defaults">
      <subsection name="Overview">
        <p>
        A simple default property value discovery API that makes it very
        easy to define a policy for searching for and merging property values.
        </p>

        <p>
        The Defaults class is a Properties subclass that holds the default
        property values discovered.  It contains special methods to access
        multi-valued properties using a property name based enumeration scheme.
        Other nice features include a macro expansion facility and prepackaged
        finders for locating defaults in other default property sources.
        </p>

        <p>
        Below in order is an the environment listing, the contents of
	a properties file, and the code used to discover and print out
	the default values discovered.  The last item is the output.
	The defaults are searched for in the defaults.properties file, 
	the shell environment and the system properties:
