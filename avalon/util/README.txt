IMPORTANT

Between version 1.0 and 1.1 (snapshot build from 20040130), the id of the 
utilities plugin was changed from avalon-plugin to avalon-util-plugin.  
Please check that your maven plugin directory DOES NOT contain the old
avalon-plugin (if it does please delete the avalon-plugin-1.0.jar file and
the avalon-plugin-1.0 directory).  

To use the avalon-util-plugin please ensure that the jar file is copies to 
you maven/plugins directory.
