                  ----------------------

This is the Excalibur (X)Conf (F)ile (C)onverter package which contains
a tool for the conversion of container configuration files.

XFC defines a Module interface which container specific implementations
use to convert roles/xconf/etc files from one container format (eg. ECM)
to another (eg. Fortress).
