        Avalon Excalibur's resource management code allows you to
        be notified when a resource has changed.  There are two
        methods of resource management: active and passive.  Passive
        resource management acts as a holder for resources, and after
        the resource has been modified through it's normal API,
        notification goes to all listeners.  Active resource management
        does the same, but it also polls the resources periodically
        to see if the resource was modified through an external method.
        Active resource management is perfect for monitoring files
        because they can be modified by external programs, and your
        program will be notified when the change occurs instead of
        constantly polling it.

        The resource management API uses regular JavaBeans property
        change event handling.
