<p>
The meta.data.builder package contains a revised implementation of the meta.model
builder that is focussed towards the creation of a serialized deployment scenario
that can be  supplied to a container for execution.

THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL WORK-IN-PROGRESS AND IS NOT IN USE WITHIN 
THE MERLIN RUNTIME AT THIS TIME.
