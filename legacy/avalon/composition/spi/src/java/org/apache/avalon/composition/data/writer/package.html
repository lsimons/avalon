<p>
The meta.data.writer package contains a revised implementation of the meta.model
writer that is focussed towards the creation of a serialized deployment scenario
that can be supplied to a container for execution.

<p>
THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL WORK-IN-PROGRESS AND IS NOT IN USE WITHIN 
THE MERLIN RUNTIME AT THIS TIME.
