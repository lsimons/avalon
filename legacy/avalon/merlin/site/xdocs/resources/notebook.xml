      <subsection name="Release Preparation">

<p>
Over the last few months the level of interest and activity in Merlin has been growing.  In addition I have received several requests for a release of Merlin by people that want to get involved but really need a release before jumping in.
</p>

<p>Doing a release has several benefits:</p>

 <ul>
  <li>will facilitate broader feedback from users</li>
  <li>will facilitate the expansion of the development community</li>
  <li>will enable classic binary downloads for people without CVS access</li>
 </ul>

<p>
Some of the actions that should be taken before a release include the following:
</p>

        <table>
          <tr><th>Action</th><th>Status</th></tr>
          <tr><td>custom contextualization tutorials</td><td>DONE</td></tr>
          <tr>
            <td>add documentation concerning the Merlin/Maven plugin</td>
            <td>DONE</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>documentation on configuration/categories targets</td>

          </tr>
          <tr>
