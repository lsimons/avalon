      The <a href="http://avalon.apache.org/repository">Avalon Repository</a> 
      system provides the Merlin platform with a complete resource management 
      framework.

          <td>
          The Avalon Repository provides support for an artifact cache.  Artifacts
          are addressable using the host independent <strong>artifact:</strong> 
          protocol.  The repository system maps artifact references to physical 
          resources and handles resource downloading and local caching.

        <tr>
          <td>Classloader Management</td>
          <td>
          Some artifacts declare a <strong>meta</strong> MIME type extension which
          contains information about an artifact's structural dependecies. The 
          repository system uses this information to dynamically construct classloaders
          and factory objects.  These capabilities are central to the bootstrapping
          facilities provided by the Avalon Repository package.

          <td>Resource Management API</td>
          <td>
          The Avalon Repository is a Java API, SPI, reference 
          implementation and bootstrap platform that provides support for  
          dynamic artifact loading, classloader chain 
          creation, and generic application bootstrapping.
