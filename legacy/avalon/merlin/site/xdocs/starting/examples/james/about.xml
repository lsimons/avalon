        <p>
        The Java Apache Mail Enterprise Server (a.k.a. Apache 
        James) is a 100% pure Java SMTP and POP3 Mail server and 
        NNTP News server designed to be a complete and portable 
        enterprise mail engine solution based on currently available 
        open protocols.
        </p>
        <p>
        James is also a mail application platform. The James project 
        hosts the Apache Mailet API, and James provides an 
        implementation of this mail application platform API.

              Apache James is be a 100% pure Java application
              based on the Java 2 platform and the JavaMail 1.3 API.

              <p>
              Unlike other mail engines, protocols are seen only
              like "communication languages" ruling comunications between clients and
              the server. Apache James is not be tied to any particular protocol but
              follow an abstracted server design (like JavaMail did on the
              client side).

              The mail system is able to handle both mail
              transport and storage in a single server application. Apache James
              in combnination with the Merlin platform works alone without the need 
              for any other server or solution.

               Apache James supports the Apache Mailet API. A Mailet
               is a discrete piece of mail-processing logic which is incorporated into
               a Mailet-compliant mail-server's processing. This easy-to-write,
               easy-to-use pattern allows developers to build powerful customized mail
               systems. Examples of the services a Mailet might provide include: a
               mail-to-fax or mail-to-phone transformer, a filter, a language translator, a mailing
               list manager, etc. Several Mailets are included in the JAMES
               distribution (see 
               <a href="http://james.apache.org/documentation_2_1.html">documentation</a>).

            <td>
              <p>
              Like protocols, resources are abstracted and,
              accessed through defined interfaces (JavaMail for transport, JDBC for
              spool storage or user accounts in RDBMS's, Apache Mailet API). The server is
              highly modular and reuse solutions from other projects.

              <p>
              Based on the technology developed
              for the Apache JServ servlet engine, Apache James has a careful,
              security-oriented, full multi-threaded design, to allow performance,
              scalability and mission-critical use.
