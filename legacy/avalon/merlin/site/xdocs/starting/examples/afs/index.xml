              The Simple Bank implementation aims to establish a minimal 
              implementation - unsecured, simplistic, but functional. The 
              example demonstrates a bank component and non-component artefacts
              (such as an account) together with test cases that demonstrate 
              account creation, depositing and withdrawal of funds, serialization
              of the state of the bank, and account closure.
