      <subsection name="Tutorial Overview">
        <p>
        This tutorial takes you though the creation of a very simple
        component, the declaration of a component type descriptor, and the 
        declaration of a block containing the component.
        </p>
        <p>
        Resources (sample code and build files) supporting this tutorial 
        are included in the Merlin distribution under the tutorials/hello
        directory.

      <subsection name="Creating a component">
        <p>
           The following code is a minimal component.  It simply logs a 
           message.  We will progressively extend this component to do 
           more creative things as we proceed through this tutorial.
        </p>

      <subsection name="Creating a Type Descriptor">
      
        <p>
          In order for Merlin to recognize this class as a component, we need to
          generate a &lt;classname&gt;.xinfo file. This can be done
          automatically by including a pre-goal as shown below into the 
          maven.xml file. 
        </p>
<source><![CDATA[
<preGoal name="java:compile">
  <attainGoal name="avalon:meta"/>
</preGoal>
]]></source>
        <p>
          The avalon:meta plugin looks for @avalon tags in the
          source code, to generate the correct Type Descriptor. In the above 
          example it will find the @avalon.component tag in the class level 
          javadocs and generate component the descriptors for us (see below). 
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Generated Type Descriptor">
        <p>
          The following text is an example of a component type definition.  
          It contains the declaration of the component name and the component 
          implementation version. From the example above 
          ( <code>@avalon.component version="1.0" name="hello"</code> ) the
          generated Type Descriptor would look something like this.
        </p>
<source><![CDATA[
<type>
  <info>
    <name>hello</name>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <lifestyle>singleton</lifestyle>
    <collection>hard</collection>
  </info>
</type>
]]></source>

      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Creating a block">
        <p>
          A block is the definition of a composite component. It represents an
          application made up of a set of components and the supporting 
          resources.  In our example the block will contain the single 
          HelloComponent component.  Based on this information Merlin will 
          create a container named "tutorial", create a component model 
          named "hello" and deploy an instance of the component on 
          startup.
        </p>
<source><![CDATA[
<container name="tutorial">

   <component name="hello" class="tutorial.HelloComponent"/>

</container>
]]></source>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Execution">
        <p>
        The next tutorial - titled <a href="execution.html">Running Hello</a> 
        covers deployment of the component using the Merlin runtime platform.
