              The Avalon Meta Model defines the functional structure
              of component types and services. A Type definition contains 
              information about deployment and runtime dependencies together 
              with information about the services that a
              component type can provide.

               Avalon provides a set of tools that automate the process 
               of generating meta-info descriptors.  These tools provide
               support for the generation of serializable and XML based
               descriptors that are collocated with class files. Tool 
               support is available for Ant and Maven.

            <td>
               Type and service meta models are established as 
               immutable objects that complement the classic information
               available about a class.  Using the Type and Service 
               descriptor classes, developers can be assured of greater
               portability and interoperability of container-side applications.
