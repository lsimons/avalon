      <p>
        The Avalon Framework consists of interfaces
        that define relationships between commonly used application components,
        best-of-practice pattern enforcements, and several
        lightweight convenience implementations of the generic components.
      </p>
      <subsection name="Guide to Avalon Framework">
        <p>
          The Avalon Framework is based on several important programming
          concepts (design patterns and COP) which are applied throughout
          Avalon. These concepts are introduced under the heading
          <a href="./cop/index.html">Component Oriented</a>.  Application 
          of these concepts within Avalon is addressed under 
          <a href="./principals/index.html">Component Development</a>.
