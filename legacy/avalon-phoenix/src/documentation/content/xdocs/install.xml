<section><title>Installation</title>

<p>
    Phoenix runs on a variety of platforms that have installed the Java 2 Virtual Machine.
</p>

<p>
    Everything required to run Phoenix and develop Phoenix based products comes with the
    distribution. If you wish to help develop Avalon/Phoenix then it is recomended that you
    obtain the full source tree from CVS or from the nightly builds.

<section><title>Compiling</title>

<p>
    Execute the relevant platform specific script (build.[sh|bat]) in the base phoenix
    directory.
</p>

<p>
    Executing this script will create a <em>dist</em> directory within the Phoenix
    directory. The <em>dist</em> directory will contain the
    compiled class files packaged into jars.
