A set of classes supporting the representation of information about a
component type.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This package includes a set of classes supporting the representation of
information about a component type.  This information is refered to as
component meta-info.  Component meta-info deals primarily with the
declaration of the services implemented by a component type, the service
dependecies that a component type has on other components, and lastly,
general information of the component including its name, implementation
version and related features.<p>

<h3>Package Structure (UML)</h3>

<p>The info package allows many of the descriptors to contain
extra attributes. These attributes offer mechanisms via which
the container can determine extra information about a
component. This information may or may not determine the behaviour
of the container towards the component.</p>

<p>For example a component that declared a attribute "avalon.mx enabled=true"
on a service it provided would indicate to the container that the service
is part of the management interface of the component. However it is up to
the container to recognize the significance of the attribute and if supported
the attribute should be acted.</p>

<p>To ease the development of containers and components this document will
document a set of common attributes that are common across containers.
However it should be noted that any container provider is allowed to create
a set of new attributes that the particular container is capable of handling.
It should be noted that these attributes will usually be in a container
specific namespace.</p>

<p>Any container is welcome to create their own namespace in which they can
define any attributes they see fit. The namespace should be equal to the
shortname of the container. For example if the
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/avalon/phoenix">Phoenix</a> container wanted
to add extra attributes it would use a namespace "phoenix" while the Fortress
container would use the "fortress" namespace.</p>
