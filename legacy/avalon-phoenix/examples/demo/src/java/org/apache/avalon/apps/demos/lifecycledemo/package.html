<h1>The 'Lifecycle' Demo Application</h1>
<center>By Paul Hammant</center>

<p>The lifecycle demo shows only the calling of the lifecycle methods
under Phoenix control.  This app has meaning when you consider the
<a href="http://avalon.apache.org/framework/reference-the-lifecycle.html">
lifecycle</a> page.</p>
<p>Do not forget that the lifecycle methods are optional.  You cann implement
all of them, as this demo does, some or none of them.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>This is the output that appears in the Console that Phoenix was called from:</p>
