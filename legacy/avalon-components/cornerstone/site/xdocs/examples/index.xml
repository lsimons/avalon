        <p>
        Component management is intrinsically linked with the containment 
        environment with which a component is deployed.  A container provides
        functions covering the establishment of a component, subsequent 
        deployment and component decommissioning. At this time there are three
        production quality containers with Avalon.  These include  
        <a href="http://avalon.apache.org/excalibur/fortress">Fortress</a>, 
        <a href="http://avalon.apache.org/phoenix">Phoenix</a>, and the 
        <a href="http://avalon.apache.org/sandbox/merlin">
        Merlin Service Management Platform</a>.  The following links provide
        examples of the deployment of cornerstone components across one or 
        more of the these respective containers.

              Merlin Service Management Platform</a>. Currently the tutorials 
              address the Thread component.  Tutorials will be expanded to 
              include all cornerstone candidate-release components as part of
              the overall cornerstone release process.
