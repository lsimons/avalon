    <p>
      
        Fortress has two design goals: facilitate heirarchical containers and
        take management functions outside of the critical path. The critical
        path is the code execution path that is required to find and use a
        component. Fortress assumes that the developer has explicit knowledge of
        his domain--which Fortress itself would never have any knowledge of. It
        also assumes that there is one root container, although it does not
        force that upon the developer.
      
    </p>
   
    <div class="h4">
      
      
        <h4>
          <a name="Asynchronous Management">Asynchronous Management</a>
        </h4>
      
      
    <p>
      
          Due to the long startup times of certain components like the
          DataSourceComponent ECM based code suffered from slowness. The problem
          was also made worse by the delayed loading and running of components.
          Components would only be instantiated when they were first looked
          up--which made problems for components that needed to be started
          immediately.
        
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
          Fortress makes use of the Event package's CommandManager so that all
          components can be started up immediately, but it is done in the
          background. That means that components are still starting while
          Fortress is ready to work. If a component hasn't been started yet
          before it is needed, then Fortress will make sure it starts before it
          turns over the requested component. It will also make sure no
          component gets started twice.
        
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
          All component pool sizing and management is done by background threads
          so that as Fortress responds to requests for components, it manages
          resources without adding that cost to the client code. That means the
          critical path (the code that actually does the work of the system) is
          not delayed unnecessarily.

        </h4>
      
      
    <p>
      
          Part of the design concept for Fortress heirarchical containers is to
          use a ContainerManager to make sure all the necessary services are set
          up and running. For example, the Fortress container needs a
          CommandManager--so the ContainerManager checks to see if it is already
          set up and uses it. That way we can have one Container that has one or
          more ContainerManagers that all use the kernel level services of the
          parent container.
        
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
          The kernel level services are: CommandManager, InstrumentManager,
          LoggerManager and ThreadManager. The actual setup and configuration of
          these services are done using a Context. The choice for the Context
          object was a conscious decision because we didn't want to extend the
          objects in a proprietary manner (LoggerManageable, etc.) like the ECM
          did. By passing the kernel services in the context, the kernel
          services can be forwarded to any child containers.
        
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
          To assist in the setup of the Context, Fortress uses a ContextManager.
          The ContextManager will either set up the context based on a Context
          passed in, or from a default context. Once the ContextManager assists
          the ContainerManager to set up any missing kernel services, you can
          get the Container from the ContainerManager and start using it.

    <p>
      
            Each domain has its own needs. For instance, Cocoon is based on a
            request/response processing model. Component based tools are based
            on a useage model. Swing based Apps are based on other models. There
            is no one size fits all solution, and Fortress can be used in all of
            these solutions. As an interim solution, the DefaultContainer does
            have one public method exposed: 
    <code>
      getServiceManager()
    </code>
   .

        </h3>
      
      
    <p>
      
            This was actually planned in a future release. There are some issues
            to work out with a central kernel though. Those issues include how
            to detect and set up sub-containers, how to make sure the container
            instance you want is set up instead of the default version, etc. In
            essence, what is needed is 
    <em>
      meta information
    </em>
   . Meta
            information is information about the container heirarchy and the
            components involved. In the future Avalon Container: Merlin ,
            has a proper meta model.

    <p>
      
          Due to the fact there are many ways of implementing the "preferred
          practices" for role naming, different components make assumptions
          about their environment.  The chief problem with these assumptions
          is that it reduces the availability for which components can work
          with each other.  Some components expect only one component to be
          mapped, while another component may expect to lookup choices in
          a ServiceSelector, while yet another may expect to find it via a
          stylized entry.  To recap, the supported lookup styles are:
        
    </p>
   
    <ul>
      
          
    <li>
      lookup(MyComponent.ROLE)
    </li>
   
          
    <li>
      lookup(MyComponent.ROLE + "Selector").select(hint)
    </li>
   
          
    <li>
      lookup(MyComponent.ROLE + "/" + hint)
    </li>
   
        
    </ul>
   
    <p>
      
          In the first case, the component that requires an external component
          asks for the mapped component via the role name.  It expects only
          one component to be mapped.  If Fortress has multiple components
          available, it will only return the default version.  The default
          version is the first entry in the configuration file, unless you
          add the magic attribute "default" with the value "true".  The last
          component for the role with that attribute is the default value.
        
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
          In the second case, the component expects to be able to select the
          component from a ServiceSelector, mapped to the ROLE + "Selector"
          entry.  Fortress will manufacture a ServiceSelector for you, and
          all will be as expected.
        
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
          In the last case, the component expects to be able to look up the
          component based on the ROLE and the hint combined.  The magic
          separator is the "/" character.  Fortress will be able to interpret
          that and skip the ServiceSelector step.
