    We will use a hypothetical business server to demonstrate
    how to identify services and components.  After we define some
    services that are used in the system, we will take one of those
    services and define the different components needed by the
    service.  The goal is to pass on some concepts that will help
    you define your system in manageable pieces.

        A component is the combination of a work interface, and the

        coupling between objects, allowing the implementation to
        change independently of its clients.

      While these definitions provide a starting place, they don't
      give the whole picture.  In order to decompose a system (defined
      as a group of facilities that comprise a project) into the
      necessary parts, we advocate a top-down approach.  That way you
      will avoid being bogged down in details before you know what the
      different facilities are.

        You always have to start out with a general idea of what your
        project is supposed to accomplish.  In the commercial world, the
        initial statement of work accomplishes this.  In the open source
        world, this is usually accomplished by an idea or brainstorming
        session.  It can't be stressed enough the importance of having a 
        high level view of the project.

        Obviously, a large project will be comprised of many different
        services, and a small project will only have one or two.  If you
        start to feel a bit overwhelmed, just remind yourself that a large
        project is really an umbrella for a bunch of smaller projects.
        Eventually, you will get to the point where you will be able to
        comprehend the big picture.

      The Business Server is a hypothetical project.  For the purpose
      of our discussion, its function is to handle sales orders,
      automatically bill customers, and manage the inventory control.
      Sales orders have to be processed as they come in, using some
      kind of transaction system.  The server automatically bills the
      customers 30 days after the sales order is filled.  The inventory
      is managed by both the server and by the current inventory counted
      at the factory or warehouse.  The business server will be a
      distributed system, and each server will communicate with others
      via a messaging service.

      Application design using Component Oriented patterns, surrounds around
      the 
    <em>
      Service
    </em>
    and decomposition of each 
    <em>
      Service
    </em>
    into
      smaller services. This is repeated until a natural size of low-level
      services are found, and a composition structure of the smaller
      services into each of the larger ones. Avalon Merlin has the features
      required to aggregate components into larger ones, and the 
      
    <em>
      Service Composition Model
    </em>
    can be mapped one-to-one with
      Avalon Merlin's composition model, taking design, implementation and
      re-use to new levels.

    <p>
      
      We will use the Business Server Project to discover the services.
      Considering the overly broad statement of work, we can immediately
      begin to see some services defined in the description of the
      project.  The list of services will be split into explicit ones
      (services that can immediately be derived from the statement of
      work) and implicit ones (services that are discovered due to similar
      work or as supporting the explicit services).  Please note that the
      implementing company will develop not all of the services-some will
      be purchased as commercial solutions.  In those cases, we will
      probably put a wrapper so that we still have a specific way of
      interacting with the commercial product.  The implementing company
      will build the majority of the services.

        It is important to realize that a 
    <em>
      Service Contract
    </em>
    is more
        than just the Java interface. For each method in the interface,
        there are arguments, and there are often rules surrounding these
        arguments. Some arguments or return values are value objects that
        belongs to the 
    <em>
      Service Contract
    </em>
   , and have rules of 
        engagement associated with them, and the same goes for Exceptions
        that may be used.
        All these rules are part of the 
    <em>
      Service Contract
    </em>
    and must 
        be well-documented This is the responsibility of the design team, 
        and the design methodology used will prescribe how this is managed.
        In case of no formal design methodology, we recommend that as a
        minimum, all the pre-requisites and rules are documented as Javadocs,
        as we have found that it is the easiest way to keep them up-to-date
        and available to the implementation developers (many IDEs have 
        context-sensitive JavaDoc pop-ups).

        We can quickly derive a number of services from the statement
        of work.  Our work is not done after this initial analysis,
        because the definition of some services requires the existence
        of other services.

    <p>
      
          The statement of work specifies that "Sales orders have to be
          processed as they come in".  This means we need to have a
          mechanism of receiving sales requests and automatically process
          them.  This is similar to the way web servers work.  They
          receive a request for a resource, process it, and return a
          result (e.g. the HTML page).  This is known as Transaction
          Processing.
        
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
          To be fair, there are different types of transactions.  The
          generic transaction service will most likely have to be broken
          down into something more specific like a "Sales Order Processor".
          The approach has to do with how generic you make your service.
          There is a balance between usability and reusability.  The more
          generic a service is, the more reusable it is.  Usually it is
          also more difficult to comprehend.

          There are a couple of instances where an event must be scheduled
          for a specified amount of time after a transaction.  In addition,
          the inventory control processes need to kick off supply orders on
          a periodic basis.  Because the statement of work states "server
          automatically bills the customers 30 days after the sales order
          is filled" we need a scheduling service.  The good news is that
          Avalon Cornerstone (obsolete - check if it has been migrated to 
          Avalon Components) provides one for us so we don't have to create
          our own.

    <p>
      
          The statement of work specifies that "each server will
          communicate via a messaging service" in our distributed system.
          Let's face it, sometimes customers want a specific product or
          method they want to use.  The messaging service is a prime
          example of using another company's product.  Most likely, we
          would use Java Messaging Service (JMS) to interface with the
          Messaging Service.  Since JMS is a standard, it is unlikely
          that the interface will change any time soon.
        
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
          In practical experience, a well-designed message oriented system
          will scale better than object oriented systems (like EJB).  One
          reason for better scalability is that messaging tends to have
          lower concurrent overhead memory.  Another reason for this is that
          it is easier to spread the load of message processing across all
          servers instead of concentrating all the processing in a small
          cluster of servers (or even just one server).

    <p>
      
          While this is not a classic server piece in textbooks, it is a
          requirement of this system.  The inventory control service
          routinely monitors the records for what the factory or warehouse
          has in stock, and triggers events when stock starts running out.

        Using experience with past systems, and further breaking down
        other services will yield a number of services that the system
        needs that wasn't specified.  Due to space limitations, we will
        avoid doing a full decomposition.

          The authentication and authorization service is not necessarily

          Workflow automation is a hot development area in enterprise
          systems.  If you don't use a third party workflow management
          server, you will have to invent your own.  Workflow automation
          is generally the act of using a software system to route tasks
          through a Company's business process.  For more information,

          This definition of a "document repository" is very loosely
          defined as the current state of information in a task.  In
          other words, when the company receives a purchase order, our
          system needs to store and recall the purchase order information.
          The same goes for billing and any other process in the system
          from inventory to new customer requests.

        I hope that the examples of services for the Business Server
        project will help you discover more.  You will find that as you
        go from higher levels of abstraction down to lower levels, you
        will find more types of services required like Connection Management
        to handle requests on open ports.  Some of the services we defined
        will be implemented by third party systems such as the Messaging
        Service and the Workflow Management Service.  It is in your best
        interest to use a standard interface for these services so that
        you can change vendors later.  Some services are actually multiple
        services acting as one larger service.  Some are already available
        within Avalon Components.
      
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
        One thing to keep in mind while discovering the services in a
        system is that a service should be a high level sub-system.  This
        will help you define components using teams of analysts.  Because
        we have already identified the main services, you can have more
        than one person (or team) decompose each of the services in parallel.
        The boundaries are well defined, so there is little chance for
        overlap.  If you decide to do the parallel analysis, you should
        come back together to identify common components so that you can
        reuse as much code as possible.

      Decomposition of a system is very much a design exercise, and once the
      
    <em>
      Service Contract
    </em>
    is identified, it is a fairly 
      straight-forward process of implementing the Service into a component.
      It is during the component implementation that the Avalon specific
      patterns starts taking center stage.

        If the system is over-designed, it will show up as too small 
        components. Components should be bigger than JavaBeans, but not
        as large as commercial APIs (JavaMail for instance). After a while,
        it will become natural to see if things are "just right" or not.
        It is also important to recognize that the implementation must not,
        and probably should not, be inside a single class. Experience shows
        that it often makes sense to use several support classes, workers,
        value objects and so on to implement the 
    <em>
      Service Contract
    </em>

    <p>
      
        Although Avalon Merlin supports that a single component can implement
        more than one service, we only recommend that for components that
        wraps third-party subsystems and APIs, where it is not possible to
        break the thrid-party piece into multiple Avalon components. 
    <strong>

        People who are used to JavaBeans tend to treat everything as

        Connection, which is NOT a component. The Connection Manager is 
        the component and it can provide Connection objects, which are
        more like value objects than components.

          The DocumentRepository is our method of getting Document objects from

          The Cache is a short-term memory-based storage facility.  The
          DocumentRepository will use it to store Document objects referenced
          by a hash algorithm.  In order to promote the reusability of the

          The Guardian component is used to manage permissions based on the
          Principal.  The Guardian will load its permission sets from a

        At this point, you should have an idea of how to break a large
        application into smaller pieces, and then continuing to break
        those pieces down to managable entities. And for each such
        piece, you set out to define the Service interfaces and the 
        surrounding semantic contracts, all before needing to look at
        component implementations. In larger organizations, it will
        be possible to achieve a high level of parallelism both in
        Service design as well as in component implementations.

    <p>
      
        You will also know that a component should not be too small, 
        and not too large. The component should only have one concern.
        Over time you will become an expert in component re-use, and
        as more libraries of components becomes available, your 
        productivity will soar. You will be well set to adopt to market
        requirements, by easily exchange old and add new implementations
        of well-known domain services, with little impact on the rest
        of the system.
