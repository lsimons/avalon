Avalon Finder
=============

Description
-----------

A framework for pull based service activation.  The purpose 
of this facility is to address the resolution of ECM and Fortress
semantics whereby services are activated as a result of a request
as opposed to the classic compositon approach of push-based 
directives.

Build Procedure
---------------

To build the facility:

$ cd avalon-components/facilities/finder
$ ant
