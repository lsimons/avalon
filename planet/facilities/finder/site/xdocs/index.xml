This is a framework for pull based service activation.  The purpose 
of this facility is to address the resolution of ECM and Fortress
semantics whereby services are activated as a result of a request
as opposed to the classic compositon approach of push-based 
directives.

                A default implementation of the finder that 
                interacts with the composition model to resolve
                services dynamically.
