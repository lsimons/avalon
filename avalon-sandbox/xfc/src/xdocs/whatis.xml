    <s1 title="Introduction">
      <p>
        The Avalon project consists of several different containers that
        developers can use to write Components based on the Avalon Framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Avalon container however, is configured by a different set of
        configuration files, that are incompatible with other containers.
      </p>
      <p>
        ExcaliburComponentManager for example, uses an xconf/roles concept
        to specify components, whereas Merlin uses an xinfo/xprofile
        concept. Fortress uses a variation of ExcaliburComponentManager
        configuration files, whereas Tweety uses a flat properties file.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of XFC is to provide a tool that is able to port 
        configuration files from one container's format to another. This will
        hopefully automate and ease migration between containers.
