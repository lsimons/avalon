	  <ol>
		<li>Custom component selectors (ECM)</li>
		<p>
		  ComponentSelectors are not portable amongst containers since are they
		  are essentially subcontainers, and tied to a particular container
		  implementation.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Due to this non portability problems, custom ComponentSelectors are ignored,
		  and standard selectors are used whenever a ComponentSelector definition is
		  being defined (eg. ExcaliburComponentSelector, when converting to ECM).
		</p>

		<li>ID Attributes (Fortress)</li>
		<p>
		  Fortress xconf files usually contain an id for each component instantiation,
		  which are used as hints when selecting between different implementations
		  of the same role.
		</p>
		<p>
		  The Fortress module creates the id attributes from the shorthand name
		  of the component, or the hint name of the component if it exists. In
		  the case where someone has defined a single implementation component without
		  using a role manager neither of these values exist, so the string UNKNOWN
		  is inserted as the ID.
