Installing Merlin.
------------------

To use Merlin command line support or the Merlin NT Service
you will need to define the MERLIN_HOME environment
variable for your system and include MERLIN_HOME/bin in
your system path.  The MERLIN_HOME environment variable
should point to the /merlin directory.

Under Lunix you can do this as follows:

  $ echo '
  > # set location of merlin
  > export MERLIN_HOME=/opt/merlin
  > # include it in the path
  > export PATH=$PATH:MERLIN_HOME
  > ' > ~/.bash_profile
  $ source ~/.bash_profile

Under Windows you can set environment variables by selecting the 
Environment Tab from the System Control Panel.

To confirm that you %MERLIN_HOME% variable is correct, you
should open a new command line window and invoke the Merlin
CLI application.

Under Lunix:

  $ merlin.sh -version

Under DOS:

  $ merlin -version

The installation of Merlin is now complete, however, two plugins are
provided with the installation supporting merlin development under the 
Maven platform.  These plugins should be placed in the Maven plugin 
directory (%MAVEN_HOME%\plugins).

To complete you installation 
Two Maven plugins are included in the distribution.  These files should 
be placed in the Maven plugin directory (%MAVEN_HOME%\plugins) as shown
here:

  %MAVEN_HOME%\plugins\avalon-plugin-1.0.jar
  %MAVEN_HOME%\plugins\merlin-plugin-1.0.jar

You now have everything in place to start using the Merlin Titorial or 
building you own components.  If you have any problems, please subscribe
to and post a message to the users@avalon.apache.org list.
