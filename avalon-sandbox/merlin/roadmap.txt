Merlin Roadmap (proposed)
-------------------------

Release Manager: Stephen McConnell.
The following document declares a set of goals that establish the 
roadmap.  They are not linked to any particular release or release 
status, instead, they serve to establish a sense of project 
direction around which specific objectives can be qualified and 
progress measured.

!
! 1. evolution and maintenance goals
! ----------------------------------
! 1.1. evolution of the platform to provide equivalent
!      functionality together with migration tools supporting
!      Phoenix and Fortress user migration
!
! 1.2  periodic maintenance releases reflecting updates to
!      code, documentation, specifications, etc.
!
! 2. development goals
! --------------------
! 2.1. management - the integration of container-side
!      management facilities then will enable fine-grain
!      component and container control, including implicit
!      and explicit appliance redeployment through to
!      component activation, suspension, resumption and
!      tear-down
!
! 2.2. distribution - the integration of concepts dealing
!      with service distribution and protocols enabling
!      service availability monitoring and notification
!
! 2.3. federation - the introduction of support for the
!      consolidated management of a distributed network of
!      service management platform
!
! 2.4. security - integration of core services supporting
!      principal establishment and propagation
!
! 2.5. preservation - focussing on being able to incorporate
!      all of the above without compromising the core
!      platform


Criteria for releases should simply be based on pushing out 
binary drop-points at periodic intervals.  Actual status (alpha, 
beta, final) will depend for the different subsystems.
