This is an generally complete JNDI implementation. It provides support for naming structure navigation (visible in the test case) and in principal it provides support for directory functions although this has not been tested yet.  Work remaining is to integrate the service resolution with the merlin system, and investigate how best to leverage the meta-model.

$ cd merlin-jndi-new
$ maven jar
