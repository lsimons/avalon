# if you want to run this version of Merlin then all you need to do is
# define an evironment variable to point to your Merlin installation root
# directory, put the following command into a bat of script or whateve in 
# your path, then go for it.
# 
# 
# The -Djava.ext.dirs argument is important because it tels the JCM where 
# to find the bootstrap classes.  The rest just starts up a kernel that loads 
# an evalon-meta/assembly deployment engine and logs some stuff in the 
# process - interesting but not terribly valuable at the moment.
#

java -Djava.ext.dirs=%MERLIN_HOME%\common;%MERLIN_HOME%\lib -jar %MERLIN_HOME%\build\lib\avalon-merlin-2.0.jar %1
