<!--
The blocks.xml file contains the declaration of the blocks to be loaded
and assembled by the kernel.  Each block element declares a block name,
a path to a single jar file, an engine configuration (which may 
include declaration of additional extension directories and a block 
classpath), anad tagged configuration fragments.

<blocks>

   <!--
   DEV NOTE: - Path statements need to declared as just the filename and 
   the kernel should be resonsible for resolving the full path.  The current
   inclusion of a directory is temporary because it is making assumptions 
   about the deployment context.
