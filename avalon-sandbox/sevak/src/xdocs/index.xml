    <section name="Introduction">
      <p>
        Sevak is a wrapper for Tomcat Catalina server in a Phoenix machine.
        <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-tomcat-4.0/release/v4.0.3/">
        http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-tomcat-4.0/release/v4.0.3/</link>
        It launches Catalina under Phoenix control in embedded mode.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Usage">
      <p>
        To use Sevak, you will need to have tools.jar placed in the lib directory of 
        Phoenix.  This is not unusual as a requirement as applications like the excellent
        OrionServer have the same requirement.  This will enable JSP processing.  You will
        find it in JAVA_HOME/lib/.  We can't include this in the SAR file for two reasons.
        The first is because it is part of the Java runtime environment and we have no 
        permission to distribute that given it is copyright of Sun Microsystems.  The 
        second reason is that it is tied to the version of Java you are running.  We can't 
        provide a different base SAR for each version of the JDK (1.2, 1.2.2, 1,3, 1,3,1 ..)
      </p>   
    </section>    
    <section name="Blocks">
      <p>
        There are two blocks delivered with Sevak.  The first is the block that provides
        the deployment/undepoyment of web applications to other blocks.  That is 
        org.apache.avalon.apps.sevak.blocks.CatalinaSevakImpl.  The second is one uses the 
        first to mount Catalina's demo apps.  The block class is 
        org.apache.avalon.apps.sevak.demo.SevakTest.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Plans">      
      <p>
        Given that there are other servlet capable web servers out there, we plan to 
        provide multiple implementations of Sevak for Jetty and Jo!.
