    <s1 title="Introduction">
		<p>Avalon has <b>a lot</b> of documentation (it has a lot of code, too, but most users
		don't see this as that much of a problem). It might be difficult for you to see where
		you should get started. That's why I wrote this little document.</p>

		<p>The place you get started is what we call the avalon framework. This little bit of code
		(the jar file is about 60k), combined with quite a bit of documentation, will revolutionize
		(in time) the way you write software.</p>
