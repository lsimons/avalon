	<s1 title="Simple, simple, simple">
		<p>The one feature that Tweety has as opposed to related avalon projects is that it is
		simple, simple, simple. Following the getting started document should get you running
		tweety in about 2 minutes, and developing components in 10.</p>
  	  <s2 title="Egg">
	  	<p>Tweety is small and easy, but it can be made easier still.</p>
		<p>Take away everything but the concept of <strong>The Lifecycle</strong>, and Egg is
		what you get. Once you understand how it hatches, you can look at how it chirps!</p>
	  </s2>
  	  <s2 title="Tweety">
	  	<p>Then Tweety awaits you, and introduces the concept of a Container.</p>
		<p>It can't be simpler, one concept at a time!</p>
