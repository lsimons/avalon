	<s1 title="Why tweety?">
		<p>Some people found avalon very complex to get started with. We decided a good way to
		fix this was to provide an implementation specifically geared at learning how avalon
		works: tweety.</p>
	</s1>
	<s1 title="Will you add feature XXX to tweety?">
		<p>Very unlikely. That would probably increase tweety in size and complexity, which we
		don't want.</p>
