This is a scratchpad with some thoughts on where this is to go. Not using
bugzilla cuz I hate it, not using a wiki cuz we don't have one.

- Many people are 'abusing' Tweety (poor little birdy) by basing some
actual software or containers on it. Clearly it fills a simplificy
need. Makes one wonder how to get the rest of avalon fill that need.

- people have suggested making Tweety into some kind of reference
implementation. I don't think we should do that as it would make
Tweety so complex the code becomes difficult to read, and it is also
just about impossible as there is no definition of what a container
should and should not do and hence you cannot make a reference
implementation either.

- the getting started docs aren't going the way they should. Instead
of showing many concepts at one time, we should show them one at a
time with a class per concept.
