To get started with the .NET implementations of Avalon,
you have to install the following tools:

Nant  -> http://nant.sourceforge.net
Nunit -> http://nunit.org

We cannot provide them for you due to licensing issues.
Nant is a 100% .NET implmented build tool inspired by
ANT (http://ant.apache.org).  It is licensed under the
GPL, but if you install it separately as a tool (preferred)
then all is well.  NUnit is a testing framework inspired
by JUnit (http://junit.org), and has an installer for
you.

Once everything is installed, you can type:

> nant

to build the Avalon project.
