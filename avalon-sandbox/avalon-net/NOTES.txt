************************* Important Notes *************************


- Avalon.Net was created and tested over .Net Framework version 1.1
  NUnit supports version 1.0 and 1.1 but starts its process 
  over version 1.0 

  If you receive an error message saying something like 
  "Method not found: Array.CopyTo(arg1, arg2)", try to modify the 
  following nunit files:

    nunit-console.exe.config
    nunit-gui.exe.config

  adding the below elements to <configuration> node:

    <startup>
        <requiredRuntime  
                safemode="true"  
                imageVersion="v1.1.4322" 
                version="v1.1.4322"  />
    </startup>


- NAnt has a nunit and nunit2 tasks that handles running NUnit 
  Test Cases. For some reason we didn't have success running our 
  tests for the reason above. So we changed the nunit2 task call
  to: 

    <exec 
         program="nunit-console.exe" 
         commandline="/assembly:${output.test.file}"/>
  
  This use requires nunit-console.exe in the path. Just add the 
  \bin path in the NUnit installation directory to the path.


- If you still have problems please send an e-mail to dev@avalon.apache.org
