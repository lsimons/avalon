/** A Registry holding the RepositoryAgentFactory for each URN.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A Repository is accessed using a URN schema of:
 * <pre>
 *   urn:[type]:[location]
 * </pre>
 * The <strong>[type]</strong> part is to which the RepositoryAgentFactory is registered, and
 * the <strong>[location]</strong> part is used in the RepositoryAgentFactpry.create() method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The RepositoryTypeRegistry is responsible to parse the URN properly, so the client
 * code can pass in the full URN, without chopping off the type from the location.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example;
 * <pre>
 *   urn:plain-url:file:///opt/avalon/repository/
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To register a RepositoryAgent, we do;
 * <pre>
 *   RepositoryAgentFactory factory = new PlainURLRepositoryAgentFactory();
 *   m_RepositoryTypeRegistry.add( "plain-url", factory );
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * And to get to the repository of the URN above, we only need to do;
 * <pre>
 *   String urn = "urn:plain-url:file:///opt/avalon/repository/"
 *   RepositoryAgentFactory factory = m_RepositoryTypeRegistry.getRepositoryAgentFactory( urn );
 *   RepositoryAgent agent = factory.create( urn );
 *   if( agent.isRepositoryAvailable() )
 *   {
 *       ResourceInfo[] infos = agent.loadResourceInfo( "" );  // Load the root resource group.
 *       for( int i=0 ; i &lt; infos.length ; i++ )
 *       {
 *           String name = infos[i].getName();
 *           String description = infos[i].getDescription();
 *           :
 *           :
 *           InputStream in = agent.openInputStream( infos[i] );
 *           :
 *           :
 *       }
 *   }
 * </pre>
