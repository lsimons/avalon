    <s1 title="Warning!">

<p>
  All user accessible points in the sandbox packages are to be considered
  "alpha". This means that the developer team is not investing _any_ effort
  in providing back compatibility between alpha releases.
</p>

<p>
  This software will continue to be released as "alpha" until both code, 
  schemas and APIs will be considered stable.
</p>
  
<p>
  Until then, there will be no warranty that newer versions will maintain back
  compatibility even in the most simple cases.
</p>
  
<p>
  On the other hand, once "beta" status is reached, back incompatible changes
  will be made only if absolutely necessary to reach "final" status.
</p>
  
<p>
  The Avalon development team understands the importance of reliable
  software as well as the importance of protecting user investiments by the
  creation of a solid development platform that doesn't change.
</p>

<p>
  On the other hand, being the Avalon project a pioneer in many fields, this
  cannot be guaranteed before a final status is reached for the software.
</p>
  
<p>
  Until then, no effort will be provided to guarantee back compatibility.
</p>
  
<p>
  You have been warned.
