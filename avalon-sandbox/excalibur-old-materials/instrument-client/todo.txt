List of things that I still need to get done in the Instrument Client

1) DOCUMENTATION!! for all 3 instrument projects.

2) Add a new layout mode which places all visible charts into
a grid rather than an MDI interface.  Laying them out is a pain.
The save state feature helps a lot though.

3) Improve the Create Sample dialog so that it does a better
job of creating default names.

4) Implement the Start Maintaining Lease dialog so that you can
specify everything settable in the Create Sample dialog.

5) Add an optional IM to the client (mainly for debugging the
client)  It would also show things like the number of sample
snapshots downloaded etc.  Give you an idea of how much you are
loading down the server.   That could also be added to the
instrument-manager Instrumentable though.

6) Add a new list, still thinking about where, which shows all
of the samples.  Samples can be difficult to find in the
current tree if there are a lot of Instruments.

7) Get the old menu working again so the tree can be hidden to
save space.

8) Figure out a couple of altrmi oddities (probably the
client's fault).  If you leave the client running while
stopping and starting the server several times, you will
sometimes get errors in one or the other's console.  Altrmi
also has a timeout where it keeps trying to reconnect to the
server for a while before finally giving up...

9) Localization.  I want to extract everything into resource
files so that the interface can be localized.

10) Add ability to set the interval at which sample snapshots
are requested.

11) Maybe add the ability to receive logger output?  Unrelated.
