    <s1 title="Introduction">
      <p>
        Avalon Excalibur's DataSource package in
    <code>org.apache.avalon.excalibur.datasource</code> allows you
    to manage pooled connections in one of two ways.  You can have
    the package handle it for you, or you can use a J2EE server's
    DataSource management.  It provides the same kind of access
    regardless of which method you choose--since they are obtained
    through Avalon's Component Manager infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        The DataSource package requires that you load the necessary
    driver classes at init time, but it will take care of all
    necessary issues from there.
