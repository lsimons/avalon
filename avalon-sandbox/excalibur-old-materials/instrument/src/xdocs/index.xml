      <p>
        Excalibur Instrument is an instrumentation utility that allows you
        to attach a separate JVM to your running application to determine its
        health.  Instrumentation is the process of exposing the internal state
        in a way that is easy for an administrator or help desk personell to
        digest.  Excalibur Instrumentation is such a package that you can use
        for your Avalon based projects.

        In order to use this in your projects, you need to set up your project
        using an Instrument aware container (<link href="../fortress/">Fortress</link>
        is one of them), and set up your components according to the specifications
