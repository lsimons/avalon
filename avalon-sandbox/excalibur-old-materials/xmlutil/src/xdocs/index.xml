            <p>
              Excalibur's Internationalization package is found in
              <code>org.apache.avalon.excalibur.i18n</code> (in the
              Scratchpad jar).  The XML ResourceBundle code is functional,
              but the method to access the bundles will change in the
              near future.
            </p>
            <p>
              This package is under development, and the API is not
              guaranteed to be the same when it is ready for release.
              Do not blame us if the next release of Excalibur breaks
              your code if you use this package.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Avalon team recognizes the importance of good
              internationalization packages, and as a result, will do
              our best to provide this functionality officially as
              soon as we can.  We also recognize the importance of
              good design, so we do not want to rush this any more
              than we have to.
