/**
 * Base interface for resolving a source by system identifiers.
 * Instead of using the java.net.URL classes which prevent you
 * from adding your own custom protocols in a server environment,
 * you should use this resolver for all URLs.
 *
 * The resolver creates for each source a <code>Source</code>
 * object, which could then be asked for an <code>InputStream</code>
 * etc.
 *
 * When the <code>Source</code> object is no longer needed
 * it must be released using the resolver. This is very similar like
 * looking up components from a <code>ComponentLocator</code>.
 * In fact a source object can implement most lifecycle interfaces
 * like Composable, Initializable, Disposable etc.
