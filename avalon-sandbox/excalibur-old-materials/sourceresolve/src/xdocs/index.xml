    <s1 title="Introduction">
      <p>
        A very common problem is resolving a source, which means
        finding a source using a URI.
      </p>
      <p>
        The source resolver of Avalon Excalibur is a component
        helping you in this task. It resolves sources from a given
        URI. The URI can use all available protocols of the JVM.
        In addition own protocols can be plugged-in.
      </p>
      <p>
        The architecture of this package is simple but powerful.
        The main component is the SourceResolver. It is used
        to resolve any URI. If the SourceResolver can resolve the
        protocol of the URI, it returns a Source object. This Source
        object is an abstraction of the underlying resource. This
        resource can be accessed by a provided InputStream.
      </p>
      <p>
        Own protocols can be configured using the SourceFactory interface.
        Whenever the SourceResolver finds a protocol which it can't handle
        by itself, it gets a role selector for a SourceFactory and tries
        to get a component with the role name of the protocol.
        If such a factory exists, the source creation is passed on to this
        factory.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Source object is handled similar to any other Avalon component.
        After it has been used it must be released using the SourceResolver.
        In addition the implementation of the Source object can implement
        any of the lifecycle interfaces of usual components and it gets
        all the information from the SourceResolver.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Source object is a lightwight object which can be extended with
        several interface. For example the XMLizable interface from the XML
        package to generate SAX events from the Source. Or the Monitorable
        interface from the monitor package to monitor the resource.
      </p>
      <p>
        For caching purposes the Source object offers a SourceValidity object
        which can be used in addition to the system ID of the Source to verify
        if a cache contains a valid version of the Source object.
      </p>
