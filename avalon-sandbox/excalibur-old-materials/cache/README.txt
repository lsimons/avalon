                  Avalons Excalibur Cache
                  -----------------------

WARNING: Under Development--the API may change

The Cache component is a set of classes that allow you to cache
objects to memory.  It gives you a flexible and plugable API
to allow you to specify the exact policies you want.

Getting Started:
----------------

If you downloaded a source release of the component then you 
will need to build the component. Directions for building the 
component are located in BUILDING.txt

If you downloaded a binary release, or a release with both binary 
and source then it is recomended you look over the documentation
in docs/index.html - and then look into the examples/ directory
for examples of the component in action.
