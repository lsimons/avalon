        <section><title>Introduction</title>
            <p>
            This project contains utilities for managing components. ECM
            is what we call an "avalon container", though it is somewhat
            different in architecture to newer developments like phoenix
            and fortress. Our intend is to someday completely replace ECM
            with fortress.
            In particular, this package contains the
            ExcaliburComponentManager, usually abbreviated to ECM.

          <p>
            The <code>org.apache.avalon.excalibur.component</code> package
    	    in Excalibur will allow you to manage components specified in
    	    a configuration file.  The beauty of this approach is that the
    	    ComponentManagers and ComponentSelectors become the Container
    	    and automagically maintain your Component's lifecycle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Excalibur Component Management infrastructure uses a
    	    RoleManager to help your configuration files remain readable.
    	    All classes are instantiated using the current thread's
    	    ContextClassLoader--unless you pass a different one in the
    	    constructor.
          </p>

            <p>
                ECM is well-documented in the Developing with Avalon
                whitepaper available
                <link href="http://avalon.apache.org/developing/">here</link>.
