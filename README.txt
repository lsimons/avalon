The following branch points may be of interest:

 * historical/before-big-reorg
 * historical/avalon-framework-4.0
 * historical/avalon-phoenix-4.0.4
 * historical/avalon-framework-4.1.3
 * historical/avalon-framework-4.1.4
 * historical/excalibur-fortress-1.0
 * historical/tweety
 * historical/before-big-reorg
 * trunk

This 'main' branch forks off from the before-big-reorg branch.

Most of the code that came after, which is found on the trunk branch,
was never released by the Apache project.

With the exception of the avalon-phoenix-4.0.4 branch, these branches
are snapshots of the whole tree at the time a particular important
software release was produced from the source code. The phoenix branch
is a partial branch only, because it was a branch that was migrated
from CVS to SVN to GIT, and the Apache Avalon team used partial
branching while using CVS.
