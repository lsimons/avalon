To Build DynamicProxy you'll need:

NAnt  -> http://nant.sourceforge.net
(Tested against version 0.85)

NUnit is not a requirement as NAnt already includes it. 
We cannot provide them for you due to licensing issues.
Nant is a 100% .NET implemented build tool inspired by
ANT (http://ant.apache.org).  It is licensed under the
GPL, but if you install it separately as a tool (preferred)
then all is well.  NUnit is a testing framework inspired
by JUnit (http://junit.org), and has an installer for
you. 

Once your environment is set up you can type: 

> nant



Enjoy!
