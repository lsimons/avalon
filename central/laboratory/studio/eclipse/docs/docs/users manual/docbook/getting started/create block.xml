  <title>Create a new block</title>

  <para>In MerlinStudio a block is equivalent to an eclipse project. In order
  to create a block you have to create an eclipse project with a special
  project nature.</para>

  <para>To create a new block you have to follow the following steps:</para>

  <para>1. Select the menu item File &gt; New &gt; Project.... to open the New
  Project wizard</para>

  <para><inlinegraphic fileref="../../../resources/NewProject.gif" /></para>

  <para>2. Enter the project name. This is done exactly the same way, as you
  do it with normal Java projects</para>

  <para><inlinegraphic
  fileref="../../../resources/NewProjectPage.gif" /></para>

  <para>3. In the next page you can select the type of project you would like
  to start with.</para>

  <para><inlinegraphic
  fileref="../../../resources/NewProjectSelection.gif" /></para>

  <para>With the current version of MerlinStudio there are only a few types as
  example projects avalilable. This will changed in future versions so that
  one has a full range of ready to use blocks / components. Note: Those
  project types are fully customizable, so that you may create your own in
  detail projects or adopt them to your enterprise standards. How to customize
  the project types is described here.</para>

  <para>4. If you now press "Finish" the complete Project - aligned with your
  selected type - will be created for you. You should now see a new project
  with the following structure:</para>
