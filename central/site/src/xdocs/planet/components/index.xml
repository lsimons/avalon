            The ConnectionManager service provides a facility to listen 
            for incoming socket connections.
            The DefaultConnectionManager compoent gives a thread pooled 
            implementation of this service. If there are multiple server 
            components depending on this component, they would all share
            the same thread pool.

            The DataSourceSelector service provides a way to select 
            DataSourceComponent.
            The DefaultDataSourceSelector component provides a set of 
            ready to use DataSourceComponents.

           The TimeScheduler service provides a services supporting the 
           scheduling of activities to occur an certain intervals.
           The DefaultTimeScheduler block implements the service. When
           used in conjunction with the service is it a TimeTrigger.  
           There are two such tiggers provided within the implementation
           CronTimeTrigger and PeriodicTimeTigger.

            The SocketManager service provides a way to lookup a factory 
            for server of client sockets.  This service is provided by the 
            DefaultSocketManager component.

              Streams without knowing how they are stored.
              The RepositoryManager block implements this service and 
              provides (in invocation of select(..) ) an appropriate 
              Respository.  The two configurable implementations use the 
              local file system for storage.
