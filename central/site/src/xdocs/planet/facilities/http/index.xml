              The Http Facility is a collection of componentized Jetty parts,
              that allows you to configure Jetty in practically any way you
              want. It also connects into the Merlin component model, and
              you can make components that serves HTTP requests. 
            </p>

          <subsection name="Component Requirement">
            <p>
              The components that wishes to serve HTTP requests need to 
              implement <code>org.apache.avalon.http.HttpRequestHandler</code>,
              which is a stripped down version of Jetty's 
              org.mortbay.http.HttpHandler, taking the same arguments.

          <subsection name="Assembled Facility">
            <p>
              To make life easier for everyone involved, we have assembled a 
              couple of standard Jetty configurations, and these can easily be
              included in your application with a single &lt;include&gt; in your
              block file. The configuration details can be overriden by the
              standard 'targets' mechanism in Merlin, which allows named targets,
              configuration and parameters, to be assigned to blocks or part of
              the blocks.
            </p>

          <subsection name="Facility Parts">
            <p>
              The Facility Parts are basically the components that has been 
              created around the Jetty classes to make this work. Some of these
              components are also assembled into slightly bigger parts, to be
              more easily used in complete Assembled Http Facilities.
