        <p>
        All facilities listed below should be considered as experimental.
        In general facilities represent a powerful mechanism through components
        can interact with the cointainer meta model.  APIs are subject to change.
        Facilities described here are available in CVS. They are not production
        ready at this time.

            <td><a href="finder.html">Avalon Finder</a></td>
            <td>
              A facility that provides support for dynamic component
              aquisition.  The facility exposes methods that allow
              non-privaliged components to delegate activation request
              to the finder.  The finder will return a service reference
              to the client application.

            <td><a href="http.html">Avalon HTTP</a></td>
            <td>
              A facility that handles redirection of HTTP requests to
              components.  This facility scans the containment model for 
              for components implement HTTP request handlers and provides
              support for the redirection of incomming HTTP requests to 
              classic compoennts - providing a integration layer
              between web-centric protocols and components.

            <td><a href="jmx.html">Avalon JMX</a></td>
            <td>
              A facility that handles Java Management Extensions, JMX.
              It allows components to declare their JMX MBeans, and the
              facility will expose these over the JMX HTTP connector.
              Support for JSR-160 is planned.
