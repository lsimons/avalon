    <section name="Reflector Facility">
      <p>
        The Reflector Facility (hereafter Reflector) is a troubleshooting
        tool for the developer. By loading/installing the Reflector facility
        it is possible to navigate the entire application, through the
        getter methods, 
        e.g. <source>public SomeType getSomeMember()</source>. It is also 
        possible to set values through setter methods, 
        e.g. <source>public void setSomeMember( SomeType value );</source>
        In fact, it is even possible to instantiate new java objects and
        assign them, but this should be done with extreme care.
      </p>
      <subsection name="Components" >
        <p>
          The Reflector consists of a fair number of components. It is also
          designed so that additional special-case types can have their own
          type handlers, just like special treatment is given to Collection,
          Map, Dictionary, arrays and ComponentModel instances.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can read more about each component 
          <a href="components/index.html">here</a>.

      <subsection name="Blocks" >
        <p>
          Two blocks has been prepared for instant use. The Standard block
          does not include the Http server in the Http facility, but the
          Complete block does. You should use the Standard block if you
          have an Http Facility running for other purposes.
