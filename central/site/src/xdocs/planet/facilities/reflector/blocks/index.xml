      <p>
        We have prepared two blocks for instant use. The 
        <a href="standard.html"><code>Standard</code></a> block is to be used
        when there is already a Http Facility used for other purposes, whereas 
        the <a href="complete.html"><code>Complete</code></a> block includes
        the Http Facility.
