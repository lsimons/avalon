  <section name="About lifecycle extensions">

   <p>
    The Avalon Framework defines a set of standard interfaces often termed as Lifecycle
    stages that can be used by a container to determine the components requirements
    during deployment and subsequent decommissioning.
   </p>

   <p>
    Lifecycle extensions provide support for the declaration of supplimentary 
    stages above and beyond the classic Avalon stages.  These custom stages 
    can be introduced during component creation, deployment, decommissioning, 
    and release.
