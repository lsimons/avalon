<section name="History">

<p>
    This document tracks the history of the Avalon project. Avalon was
    originally started with a realisation that Java is a great
    platform for developing server products and a <a
    href="call-to-vote.html">call to vote</a>. There was a lot of
    work formalizing what exactly a <a
    href="what-is-a-server.html">server</a> consists of and why
    this project was <a
    href="need-for-avalon.html">needed</a>. These discussions led
    to the initial development of the Java Apache Server Framework.
</p>

<p>
    Over time the Java Apache Server Framework project was renamed
    Avalon. This was in recognition that the original ideas had
    evolved over time. Avalon became a repository of general utility
    code, a design and testing ground for component based solutions, a
    micro kernel and set of generalized server oriented
    services. This, combined with a move from the Java Apache project
    to the Jakarta project prompted the revision.  At this time the
    kernel code was repackaged under the name Phoenix, core services
    under the name Cornerstone and the general utilities were spun-off
    under the Excalibur project.
