      <p>
      Neeme got involved with Avalon back in 2001 when he was responsible for XMLResourceBundle
      implementation (that originated from Cocoon). Since then, XMLResourceBundle has been moved
      back to Cocoon and recently he has been more active in BCEL related areas in Fortress
      and fixing documentation here and there.
      </p>
      <p>
      Currently he is a committer to Avalon, Hibernate-Avalon (an Avalon wrapper for
      <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a> persistence framework) and
      <a href="http://cglib.sourceforge.net">CGLIB</a> (a bytecode engineering library,
      uses BCEL and is used by Hibernate). Has been a committer to
      <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/jetspeed/">Jetspeed</a> (a portal framework) and
      <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/">Turbine</a> (a web application framework).
      And he has been a long-time follower of <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org">Cocoon</a>
      (dating back to the early days of Cocoon1) and
      <a href="http://db.apache.org/torque/">Torque</a> (a persistence framework).
      </p>
      <p>In addition to the above, recently he has been interested in: bytecode engineering
      (<a href="http://cglib.sourceforge.net">CGLIB</a> and
       <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel/">BCEL</a>), java persistence
      (<a href="http://www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</a> and
       <a href="http://db.apache.org/ojb/">OJB</a>) and java UI frameworks
      (<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/jelly/">Commons Jelly Swing tag library</a>
       and XUL). Also, the discussions about avalonizing
      <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/">Turbine</a> look promising and he is
      hoping to become more active once again in Turbine-land as well.
