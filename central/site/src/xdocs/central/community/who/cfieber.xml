        Cameron started developing with Avalon in 2003 while
        investigating alternatives to a roll your own container
        implementation.  He migrated middleware solutions to Phoenix
        and then Merlin.

        As part of the migration process from Phoenix to Merlin, Cameron
        contributed a preliminary port of the Phoenix JMX support for
        Merlin.  Cameron joined Avalon as a committer in May 2004.
