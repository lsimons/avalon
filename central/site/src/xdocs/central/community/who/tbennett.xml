       Timothy discovered Avalon in the autumn of 2002 while looking for
       examples of JMX implementations for an idea he had about designing
       a Java server framework alternative to J2EE.  Much to his surprise
       and delight, someone had beat him to the punch by about five years!
       For him, the discovery of Avalon technology was something akin to
       walking through the wardrobe and into the world of Narnia.

       As a firm convert to COP, SOA, IoC, and SoC, Timothy began building
       Java server applications using Phoenix and Merlin, and finally
       joined the team as a committer in February of 2004.  His initial
       work will focus on developing web and database facilities for
       Merlin.

       As an 1989 graduate of the Georgia Institute of Technology with a degree
       in Nuclear Engineering, Timothy has long since given up splitting atoms
       for the somewhat less peaceful occupation of software development
       (and daresay open source community membership).  Currently, he lives 
       and works in Nashville, Tennessee for Global eXchange Services, where
       he designs and develops Java applications that exchange EDI business
       documents securely over the Internet.  When not writing code, you can
       likely find him at the ice rink attempting to prove wrong the sterotype
       that Southern-born Americans can never possibly learn to play ice hockey.
