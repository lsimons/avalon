    <section name="Introducing the Avalon PMC">

	<p>These pages exist only to provide some down-to-earth insight
	   in how things work at the ASF. They're informative only, not
	   normative. They may contain errors or inadequacies. IANAL.</p>

      <subsection name="What is the PMC?">
        <p>Apache is a legal entity, i.e. a real non-profit organisation,
	     with a charter, members, a board, a president, etc. You can
	     read all about that
	     <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/">here</a></p>
	    
	  <p>A PMC, Project Management Committee, is a group of people
	     appointed with the task of managing something that fits with the
	     Apache Software Foundation goals. The Avalon PMC, for example,
	     is tasked with managing Avalon.</p>

	  <p>We're all programmers, and that is what we want to occupy us
	    with. We like to share and work on our software together, which
	    is why we make it free software. However, there is always some
	    stuff which still requires management.</p>
	    
	  <p>For example, in order to protect ourselves and our users, all
	    software hosted at Apache must be properly copyrighted to the ASF,
	    and licensed under the ASF license. This is something the PMC is
	    responsible for.</p>
	    
	  <p>Also, remember that the PMC consists of the same people that do
	    the development work. There's no "bossing around" here. The PMC
	    exists only to facilitate free software developers in "doing their
	    thing", just like the ASF exists "to provide organizational, legal,
	    and financial support for the Apache Open Source software
	    projects".</p>
