      <subsection name="Using Configuration Overrides">
        <p>
        The Merlin command line tool allows the specification of a  
        set of overriding configuration targets. Each target in the 
        &lt;targets&gt; set contains a configuration that may be 
        applied to a named component.  This allows modification of a 
        configuration without modification of a packaged block.xml
        file.
        </p>
        <p>
        Resources supporting this tutorial are contained in the 
        tutorials/configuration/override directory.

      <subsection name="Execution">
        <p>
        The following command line includes the -config argument
        referencing a configuration target file (example included
        in the tutorials/configuration package).
        </p>
        <source>
$ maven
$ merlin -execute target\classes -config conf\config.xml 
</source>
        <p>
        Executing Merlin demonstrates that the configuration supplied
        to the hello component reflects the configuration element contained
        in the target name "\hello".

      <subsection name="Notes">
        <p>
        Configuration target names represent a path.  The path is the 
        construction of container names seperated by the "/" character
        and ending with a component name.  For example if the hello component
        were contained within a container named "container" the path would 
        appear as follows: 
        </p>
<source><![CDATA[
<targets>
  <target path="/container-name/component-name">
    <configuration>
      <!-- your configuration info -->
    </configuration>
  </target>
</targets>
]]></source>
