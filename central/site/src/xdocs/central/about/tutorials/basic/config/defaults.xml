      <subsection name="Creating a Default Configuration">
        <p>
        Merlin provides support for the association of a default
        with a component type.  This is achieved by including a 
        &lt;classname&gt;.xconfig resource co-located with the 
        component class.
        </p>
        <p>
        Resources supporting this tutorial are contained in the 
        tutorials/configuration/defaults/ directory.
        </p>

        <p><i>HelloComponent.xconfig</i></p>

        <p>
        Build and run the tutorial again.
        </p>
        <source>
$ maven
$ merlin -execute target\classes
</source>
        <p>
        In the logging output we see that the default configuration
        supplied to the component has been generated by the 
        information we supplied inside the xconfig resource.

        provides support for the packaging of configurations within 
        the block.xml deployment directive with a component.
