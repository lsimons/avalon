         A container can declare services that it exports.  In such a case
         the container declares one or more service directives that map 
         components declared within itself as service providers.  
         This mechanism enables a container to appear as a regular 
         component relative to other components.

      <subsection name="Sample Container">
        <p>
         The following container definition includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>an application component</p></li>
          <li><p>a location provider block included by reference</p></li>
          <li><p>an application block included by reference</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The application block declares dependencies on a location 
          and publishing service.  The location and publishing block
          declare that they provide these respective services. As a part of 
          the general component assembly process - Merlin will assemble 
          blocks relative to the services and dependencies they declare.
          When a block is deployed, it appears to other components as a 
          component providing the services it exports.  However in practice
          these services are provided by components defined within the 
          container (i.e. the container represents the definition of 
          a virtual component and the containers components and subcontainers
          represent the virtual component implementation).
        </p>
        <p>The top level application block declaration (block.xml):</p>
        <source><![CDATA[
<container name="application">

     <classloader>
       <classpath>
         <repository>
           <resource id="avalon-framework:avalon-framework-impl" version="4.1.5"/>

           <resource id="merlin-tutorial:application-impl" version="1.0"/>
         </repository>
       </classpath>
     </classloader>

     <!-- 
     note: each of the following include directives is equivalent to 
     a nested container declaration - using include or declaraing a 
     sub-container is semantically equivalent
     -->

     <include name="location" id="merlin-tutorial:locator-impl" version="1.0"/>
     <include name="publisher" id="merlin-tutorial:publisher-impl" version="1.0"/>

     <component name="application" 
        class="tutorial.application.Application">
     </component>

</container>
]]></source>
        <p>
          If we look at the location block (as an example) we will see a corresponding
          service declaration.  This declaration includes a source reference that is 
          a relative component path that tells Merlin to use the sub-component named
          "location" as the component that will fulfil the service published by this 
          block.

        <p>
         To run build and run the example please use the following commands:

$ cd application/impl
$ maven build
$ merlin target\*.jar -repository %MAVEN_HOME% -execute

         The log output demonstrates the deployment by Merlin of the blocks
         in the correct order (based on dependency resolution) and the 
         execution of the test application.

        <p>
         The primary benefit of using block level services and dependencies
         is isolation of a block implementation from the public services it 
         provides.
