      <subsection name="Granting Permissions to classes in container">
        <p>
         Starting from Merlin 3.3, it is possible to grant permissions to
         classes within a container. This is done by the declaration of a 
         &lt;grant&gt; element in the classloader definition section in
         the block descriptor (e.g. block.xml).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the example below you should be able to see the mechanism. The
          multiple &lt;action&gt; elements, instead of a single String value
          as is more common, was chosen for easier tool support while still
          allowing you to place multiple comma separated actions into a 
          single &lt;action&gt; element, passed to the Permission constructor
          as-is.
        </p>

        <p>
         There can only be a single &lt;grant&gt; for each &lt;classloader&gt;
         and any number of &lt;permission&gt; elements within.

      <subsection name="Implementing Security in Components.">
        <p>
          If you are only looking for basic security, similar to any typical
          stand-alone application, that would depend on a Java Security Policy
          file, you don't need to do anything special. All classes in Java
          will perform the security checks behind the scenes, protecting
          files, network connection and many other system resources. Please
          refer to your Java Security documentation for full details.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to guard some resource or a section of code, you will
          need to;
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Create a subclass of java.security.Permission, or one of its
            subclasses such as java.lang.BasicPermission, and override
            the implies(), equals() and hashCode() methods.
          </li>
          <li>
            Insert a AccessController.checkPermission() at the relevant
            points in your code. (See examples below.)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Examples of Security" >
        <subsection name="Using an existing Permission class">
          <p>
            This first example uses a simple named RuntimePermission.
          </p>
          <source><![CDATA[
    public SuperGlue getSuperGlue()
    {
        Permission p = new RuntimePermission( "useSuperGlue" );
        AccessController.checkPermission( p );
        return m_SuperGlue;
    }
]]></source>
          <p>
            In this example, we utilizes the existing 
            java.lang.RuntimePermission to do a very simple check, i.e is the
            current protection domain allowed to use the SuperGlue. 
          </p>
          <p>
            And to make this work in your Merlin application, you would need to
            insert the appropriate permission in the &lt;grant&gt; element.
          </p>
          <source><![CDATA[
    <container>
      <classloader>
        <!-- other stuff -->
        <grant>
          <permission class="java.lang.RuntimePermission" name="useSuperGlue" />
        </grant>
      </classloader>
    </container>
]]></source>
        </subsection>
        <subsection name="Creating a new Permission class">
          <p>
            If you need something more complicated that can not be fulfilled
            with the existing Permission classes, you will need to create your
            own. This can be rather tricky, depending on what you are actually
            trying to do.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the example below, we have a Permission class that ensures that 
            an amount is within its boundaries, for instance for a banking application.
            The semantics are;
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The name argument for a granted permission (declared) contains a 
              minimum value, followed by a dash and then followed by a maximum 
              value.
            </li>
            <li>
              The name argument for a required permission (programmatically)
              only contains a single value, which is the requested amount.
              The amount is expressed in cent, and no fractional numbers needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              If any of the two values are missing, the default is used. The
              default is 1000000 for each.
            </li>
            <li>
              The action argument contains either "deposit" or "withdrawal".
            </li>
            <li>
              The granted permission must contain the action of the required
              permission, and the required permission's amount must be within
              the limits of the granted permission.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As we can see it is a fairly straight forward algorithm, but a bit
            hard to put in words, and I hope I haven't missed something. To do
            this with Java Security permissions is fairly easy.

        <p>
          Please note that the code has not yet been tested. If you do
          please post any mistake to dev@avalon.apache.org. Thank you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then in the actual code, we would do something like this;
        </p>
          <source><![CDATA[
    public void deposit( long amount )
    {
        AmountPermission p = new AmountPermission( (String) amount, "deposit" );
        AccessController.checkPermission( p );
    }
    
    public void withdraw( long amount )
    {
        AmountPermission p = new AmountPermission( (String) amount, "withdrawal" );
        AccessController.checkPermission( p );
    }
]]></source>
        <p>
          Wasn't that easy? Well, it would have been if we could tie the principal
          customer/client/user to the protection domain that is checked. This is
          currently on the drawing board for Avalon Merlin, and will probably 
          not be ready until version 4.0, somewhere mid or late 2004.
          While awaiting this Subject-based, generic, pluggable security system,
          you can hack the above example a little bit, for some basic subject
          driven security. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In the implies() method, you reach out and detect who is executing
          the current thread, for instance through a ThreadLocal variable,
          ask some authoritive object instance for the amounts allowed and 
          perform the check. This is NOT the recommended method for larger and
          more complex system (such as banks), but can work as a temporary 
          solution for the time being.
