      <p>
        The significance of the vote on 12 March 2004 can not be 
        under-estimated, as the community has long struggled about identity 
        and divergence issues. The vote brings to an end a historical identity 
        crisis and marks the beginning of the united Avalon.
      </p>
      <p>
        For users, it is a signal that;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Framework will evolve and embrace more component aspects than currently.
        </li>
        <li>
          Work will start on a formal Test Compatibility Kit, where the 
          Avalon component specification can be validated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Merlin will become the undisputed Reference Container, and the only
          fully supported Avalon container for the foreseeable future.
        </li>
        <li>
          MerlinDeveloper's status will be improved and rejuvenated effort will
          go into bringing it to a releasable state.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fortress will be put on halt for the time being, and it is uncertain
          if a revival effort will take place later, or if it will be forked
          elsewhere.
        </li>
        <li>
          Excalibur will be terminally deprecated, and only updated with
          bug fixes to support existing users.
        </li>
        <li>
          The official website and Wiki will be updated to reflect this fact,
          i.e. references to ECM and Fortress will be removed, and the
          documentation of these containers will be move to a historical
          section.
