    <section name="Installation - Merlin 3.3">

      <subsection name="Structure">

        <p>
        After downloading the Merlin 3.3.0 binary distribution and 
        unpacking the archive into you preferred location, you should
        have a directory structure that looks like the following: 
        </p>
<source><![CDATA[
  /merlin
    /bin
    /config
    /plugins
    /system
    README.TXT
    LICENSE.TXT
    NOTICE.TXT
]]></source>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="MERLIN_HOME Environment Variable">

        <p>
To use Merlin command line support or the Merlin NT Service
you will need to define the MERLIN_HOME environment
variable for your system and include MERLIN_HOME/bin in
your system path.  The MERLIN_HOME environment variable
should point to the merlin directory.
        </p>

        <p>
Under Windows you can set environment variables by selecting the 
Environment Tab from the System Control Panel.
        </p>

        <p>
Under Lunix you can do this as follows:
        </p>

<source><![CDATA[
  $ echo '
  > # set location of merlin
  > export MERLIN_HOME=/opt/merlin
  > # include it in the path
  > export PATH=$PATH:$MERLIN_HOME/bin
  > ' >> ~/.bash_profile
  $ source ~/.bash_profile
]]></source>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="AVALON_HOME Environment Variable">

        <p>
Versions of Merlin prior to the 3.2-dev 20031210 build maintained 
a local repository of jar files under the %MERLIN_HOME%/repository
directory.  As of the 20031210 build the repository is maintained 
under AVALON_HOME/repository where AVALON_HOME defaults to 
${user.home}/.avalon.  To override the AVALON_HOME directory you 
can either define a AVALON_HOME environment variable or you can 
add a merlin.properties file to ${user.home} containing the 
"merlin.repository" property key and a value point to you preferred 
repository location.
        </p>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Maven Plugin Installation">

        <p>
The merlin system installation is now complete.  Three plugins 
supporting development are provided and can be installed using the 
commands listed below (please check the packaged INSTALL.TXT for 
correct version numbers):
        </p>

<source><![CDATA[
$ maven -DgroupId=avalon-util -DartifactId=avalon-util-plugin -Dversion=1.0.0 plugin:download
$ maven -DgroupId=avalon-meta -DartifactId=avalon-meta-plugin -Dversion=1.4.0 plugin:download
$ maven -DgroupId=merlin -DartifactId=merlin-plugin -Dversion=3.3.0 plugin:download
]]></source>

      </subsection>


      <subsection name="Validating your installation.">

        <p>
          The following instructions assume that you have defined the
          MERLIN_HOME environment variable that points the directory
          containing the Merlin installation.
        </p>

        <p>
          To confirm that you MERLIN_HOME variable is correct, you
          should open a new command line window and invoke the Merlin
          CLI application. The following command should list the
          Merlin CLI help information.
        </p>

<source><![CDATA[
$ merlin.sh -help
usage: merlin [block] [-lang <code>] [-install <url>] 
  [-library <directory>] [-help] [-version] [-home <directory>] 
  [-impl <artifact>] [-debug] [-info] [-config <url>] 
  [-context <directory>] [-system <directory>] [-execute] 
  [-repository <directory>] [-kernel <url>]...
]]></source>

      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Cygwin Notes">
        <p>
Due to restrictions related to the handling of spaces in filename 
and/or directory names when running under the Cygwin environment you 
will need to quote and escape command line arguments that contain 
references with embedded spaces. </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<source>
  merlin -home '/My\ Documents/merlin/apps/abc' -execute
</source>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Next Steps">
        <p>
          Now that you have installed Merlin on your system you can
          proceed to the <a href="../tutorial/index.html">Using Merlin</a>
          tutorial page.
