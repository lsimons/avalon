      <subsection name="The Challenge">

        <p>
The Merlin platform provides a comprehensive environment for the 
management of a broad spectrum of components.  Open source projects 
such as the <a href="http://open-im.net">OpenIM</a> instant 
messaging server, the <a href="http://phoenixjms.sourceforge.net/index.html">
PhoenixJMS</a> a JMS messaging platform, 
along with a suite of <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache</a> projects can be viewed as 
meta-driven component solutions.  Each of these initative, from 
complex system such as the <a href="http://james.apache.org/">
James</a> enterprise messaging platform through to utility components
such as the <a href="http://avalon.apache.org/cornerstone/">Cornerstone</a>
component suite (thread pools, persistence, task scheduling, etc.) can 
be represented in Merlin as pluggable services within a composite 
component context. Looking forward, the challenge will be the ability to 
locate and deploy on-demand the services you need as you need them.

      <subsection name="The Solution">
        <p>
Locating, maintaining and delivering information about available services,  
delivery solutions, and usage criteria is the aim and objective of the 
<a href="http://www.dpml.net/">Digital Product Meta Library</a> (DPML).  
Using meta information maintained under the DPML, Merlin users will be able 
aggregate benefits across diverse projects enabling the growth and development
of an advanced digital product infrastructure.
