      <section name="Commit Access under Subversion">

        <p>
          Before you can commit to the subversion repository, you will
          need to create an SVN password.  To do this, log on to 
          minotaur.apache.org and run the following command:
        </p>

        <source>  svnpasswd</source>

        <p>
          The will ask you for a subversion password.  This is the user 
          and password you will use when checking in code.  
        </p>

        <p>
          When you commit code to subversion, it will try to use the
          username you are logged in as on the current system. If this 
          is different than your subversion username, you will need to
          specifiy this on the commit statement.  Subversion will prompt 
          for your password when you run the command.  Note the is the 
          SVN password, which is not the same as your minotaur password
          This password can be entered as a command line argument to 
          avoid interaction.  The follow command line will commit with a 
          specified username and password:
        </p>
        <source>  svn commit --username <i>username</i> --password <i>password</i></source>

        <p>
          To commit with TortoiseSVN, simply right click on the directory
          you want to run the commit from and select commit.  A list of
          files changed will be displayed with a text box for a log message.
          At this point you can select which files should be committed and
          enter you log text.  Select OK to start the commit, a dialog box
          will appear prompting for username and password.  You will also
          be able to select a check box to remember the credentials.  If you
          select this check box, you will not be prompted for information in
          the future
