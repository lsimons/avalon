      The Avalon project represents over 100 versioned artifacts
      with many build, test and runtime interdependencies.  Across 
      this codebase with have a single container application, a 
      Eclipse plugin, a number of plugable platform facilities, 
      plugins that load plugins, etc. resulting in a generally 
      complex build cycle.  Following experiments with Ant and 
      Maven, the Avalon team extended the concept of a POM (Project
      Object Model) with centralized version and dependency
      management - and combined this model with the Ant platform
      to provide a powerful, fast and robust build system 
      code-named <a href="magic/index.html">Magic</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      In addition to the Magic build solution, Avalon has developed
      plugins supporting the Ant and Maven environments.
