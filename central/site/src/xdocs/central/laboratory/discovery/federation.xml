<p>The following illustration depicts a possible business cycle of a resource description used as an argument to a server:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation of the resource description, containing a description of the a supplier capability and URI reference to the server;</li>
<li>registration of the resource description under a general marketplace registry;</li>
<li>discovery of the capability under a general market directory in the form of a disclosure instance;</li>
<li>subsequent referral of the description to vertical domain marketplace;</li>
<li>discovery of the disclosure under the vertical marketplace;</li>
<li>application of the resulting disclosure instance as an argument to a  server</li>
</ul>
<p>Server applications (processors) can take advantage of referral information in Disclosure chains as part of sophisticated applications supporting referral reward schemes and market site value assessment.</p>
