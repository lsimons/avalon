    <section name="About XDoc Plugin">
      <p>
        The XDoc Plugin allows you to create the project documentation using
        XML, in the so called Anakia format, and automatically generate the
        look from a <em>theme</em>. A <em>theme</em> is a predefined XSLT
        template that the XDoc Plugin will use to generate the HTML and PDF
        (future) outputs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The theme must be located in the ${project.system}/theme directory.
