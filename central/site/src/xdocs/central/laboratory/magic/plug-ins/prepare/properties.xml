        The following properties are used by the Prepare Plugin.

            The source directories. The <code>init</code> method will copy all
            the content from these directories to the ${prepare.build.src.dir}
            with and without filtering enabled, depending on file type.

          <td>
            This is the directory where the sources will be copied to before
            processed. The copy procedure allows for filtering, where the
            content of the source files have 'tags' in them that will be
            replaced by build-time information.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            prepare.filtered.files

            **/*.xml, **/*.java, **/*.html, **/*.sh, **/*.bat, **/*.prop*
          </td>
          <td>
            A comma-separated list of files that will be filtered. All other
            files copied will be copied without filtering enabled. All 
            properties will be converted from their typical lower-case format
            to an upper-case equivalent, and any properties surrounded by the @
            character is a tag, that will be replaced by its build value. For
            instance, @PREPARE.DEST.DIR@ will be replaced by the value of the
            ${prepare.dest.dir} property, default "target/".
