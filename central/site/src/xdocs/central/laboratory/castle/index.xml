  <section name="A container for CLI">
    <p>Avalon Castle is a lightweight
    container for the CLI (.Net and Mono) world. Although it can be viewed as
    a port of Avalon, it benefits from several features offered by the
    CLR.</p>

    <p>Other important difference of Castle container is its simplicity.
    Based on Microkernel pattern, the user can easily modify, extend or
    adapt it to match his requirements. No hard contracts, no obligations.
    Just good and old Inversion of Control and stills Avalon.</p>

  <section name="Microkernel">
    <p>
    The Microkernel pattern allowed us to focus on a simple set of classes
    which constitutes the environment for managed components.

  </section>

  <section name="DynamicProxy">
    <p>
    To overcome some limitations of CLR we had to develop some other tools used 
    by Avalon Castle. DynamicProxy is a simple implementation that immitates the 
    Java proxies through Invocation handlers.
    </p>

  <section name="ManagedExtensions">
    <p>
    If one needs a more powerfull container, allowing him to managed his components 
    through some remote interface, he can use the managed extensions. 
    In fact the ManagedExtensions can be viewed as a port of JMX for CLI.
