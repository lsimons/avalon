  <section name="A container for CLI">
    <p>Avalon Castle is a lightweight
    container for the CLI (.Net and Mono) world. Although it can be viewed as
    a port of Avalon, it benefits from several features offered by the
    CLR.</p>

    <p>Other important difference of Castle container is its simplicity.
    Based on Microkernel pattern, the user can easily modify, extend or
    adapt it to match his requirements. No hard contracts, no obligations.
    Just good and old Inversion of Control and stills Avalon.</p>
