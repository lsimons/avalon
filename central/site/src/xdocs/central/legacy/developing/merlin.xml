        Avalon Merlin is the Avalon Reference container, aiming at being
        powerful, versatile and flexible. It can be used as stand-alone
        or embedded into a variety of other systems. Merlin has so many
        features, that we are not going to cover them all here, just
        reflect over the container concerns of the components.
