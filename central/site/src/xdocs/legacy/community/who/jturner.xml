      <p>
	Jeff is a 23-year old Sydney programmer who became involved with
	Avalon through a long-standing interest in the XML Cocoon project.
	After submitting a few patches, berating the lack of docs and
	examples, and gradually becoming a fan of COP, he found himself voted
	a committer and escape was impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
	Jeff has a tragic inability to overlook small deficiencies in things
	like build systems and documentation. He therefore spends much more
	time fixing these than coding, which is okay because Avalon has no
	shortage of programming talent.
