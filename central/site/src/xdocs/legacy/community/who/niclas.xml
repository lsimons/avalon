        Niclas lives, works and enjoys life in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. He says the
        relaxed attitude, stree-free environment and low cost of living
        makes Kuala Lumpur a perfect environment for software development.
        The high-tech widget/gadget crazy people, makes the region the fore-runner
        of many new technologies, adding icing to the cake of living and
        working in this vibrant city.
