        <p>
        The folowing information is a step by step decomposition of 
        a example of Merlin embedded in a main method.  The details
        presented here are the same as that used in all embedded Merlin
        scenarios.  Typically a embedded application will deviate from 
        this model to take into account the embedded context by resolving
        factory parameters relative to the execution environment.
