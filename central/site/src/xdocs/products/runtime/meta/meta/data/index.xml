      <subsection name="Overview">
        <p>Meta-info establishes functional and operational 
        constraints whereas meta-data describes data that is 
        used to fulfil those constraints.  For example we may 
        have a meta-info object that describes a component type together
        some specific context requirements.  A corresponding 
        meta-data object would describe how those requirement are 
        fulfilled.  Generally speaking, meta-info is referred to 
        as a descriptor whereas meta-data is referred to as a 
        directive. One describes a constraint - the other fulfils 
        the constraint.</p>

      <subsection name="Status">
        <p>The meta-model presented here addresses the meta-info
        aspects - itself crucial to the overall objective of establishing
        a common component criteria definition.  Within Avalon there are 
        several contains each using a container specific meta-data models.
        The objective of an Avalon Meta-Data framework is to enable a 
        common XML schema and supporting API to represent the deployment 
        information.  A common meta-data model has not been established
        at this time - however, the benefits are obvious. More 
        significantly a common meta-data model will enable intelligent 
        automation of many component management aspects in a container 
        independent fashion.  For additional information please post 
        questions to the <a href="mailto:dev@avalon.apache.org">Avalon dev 
        mailing list</a>.</p>
