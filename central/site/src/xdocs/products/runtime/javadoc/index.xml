              The set of interfaces included within the Component API define 
              the computational contract between a component and a container.
              This API in conjuction with the component tag library is primarily 
              of interest to component developers.

              The set of interfaces included within the Component SPI defines 
              the container meta-model within which component types are managed.
              This API enables dynamic component type management, container 
              management, and control over the underlying runtime. The javadoc
              included here covers both the API and SPI and if primarily of 
              interest to developers of advanced facilities.

              The Platform Javadocs cover the full suite of API, SPI and the internal
              implementation systems.  This documentation is primarily of interest to
              the core development team and developers wishing to understand the 
              overall object model.
