          The meta info model is composed of a set of descriptors 
          that are used to describe the structural information 
          and operation criteria of a component type or service.

    <subsection name="Overview">
<p>The Meta Model is an object model describing a type of Avalon component.
The meta model encompasses all information about a component that is not
specified by its work interface and/or lifecycle interfaces.
Specifically, the Meta Model allows for specification of 
lifecycle-related constraints/requirements, i.e. Context, Configuration,
Parameter, and Dependency constraints/requirements.
</p>
<p>
The Meta Model API is a set of well-known interfaces and classes that
is used to provide a runtime representation of the meta model.
</p>
<p>
The Meta Model DTDs are a set of well-known XML DTDs that provide a
mapping of the Meta Model API in XML.
</p>
<p>
The Meta Model XML API provides an implementation of the Meta Model API
that takes XML documents following the Meta Model DTDs as source.
