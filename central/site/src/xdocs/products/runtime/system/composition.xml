      <p>
      The composition model is the essential fabric that ties together the 
      Merlin model-drive architecture.

          Avalon Composition ties together component and underlying

          The <a href="../../api/org/apache/avalon/composition/model/package-summary.html">
          composition model API</a> provides support for dynamic management of the

          The composition package provides comprehensive support for the defintion
          of domain specific context handling - eliminating dependency on classic 
          Avalon deployment solutions.  Context entry handling supports custom object
          creation patterns and multiple context entry creation semantics.
