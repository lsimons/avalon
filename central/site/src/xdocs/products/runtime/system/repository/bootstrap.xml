          <p>
          A bootstap deliverable jar file is provided as part of the Avalon
          Repository distribution.  This deliverable includes the API, SPI 
          and a micro-bootstrap repository that is used to load different 
          repository implementations.  The bootstrap system provides added 
          features dealing with application deployment, including classloader
          chain establishment and application instantiation.
          </p>
          <p>
          A bootstrap profile is established relative to the following 
          environment variables and properties:

            system will atrempt to locate a value for this property when

            in the current working directory, ${user.home}, or ${avalon.home}
            relative to an avalon.properties file, the implementation will 
            resolve the default implementation from an embeded avalon.properties 
            resource.

             defaults to an equivalent system property and if underfined, will 
             attempt to locate an environment variable AVALON_HOME.  If the env 
             variable is not declared the default repository directory will 
             revert to ${user.home}/.avalon.
