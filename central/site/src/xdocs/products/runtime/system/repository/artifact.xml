          <p>
          The Avalon Repository API provides support for the notion of 
          an Artifact.  An artifact is a logical reference to a 
          physical resource. A repository implementation is reponsible 
          for the establishment of a concrete URL relative to a logical
          artifact reference.
          </p>

          <p>
          The following code fragment demonstrates the creation of an 
          artifact reference by suplying a "group", "name" and "version".
          </p>

          <source>
Artifact artifact = 
    Artifact.createArtifact( 
      "avalon-framework", "avalon-framework-api", "4.1.5" );</source>

          <p>
          Once an artifact has been created the repository is used to 
          to resolve the artifact to a concrete url.  The actual url
          returned to the client will have a transport protocol and 
          path adapted to the underlying repository type (e.g. HTTP, 
          LDAP, etc.).
          </p>

          <source>
URL url = m_repository.getResource( artifact );</source>
