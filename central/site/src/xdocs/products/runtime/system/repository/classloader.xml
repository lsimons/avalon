          <p>
          In addition to simple resource access, the repository 
          provides support for the creation of classloaders based on
          meta information associated with jar artifacts.  The repoistory
          uses the MIME type x-meta to locate suplimentary information 
          about an artifact such as dependencies, classloader structures, 
          and other related information. 
          </p>

          <p>
          The following code fragment demonstrates the creation of an 
          classloader chain involving some 30 dependent jar file spead
          across a three-tier classloader chain. 
          </p>

          <source>
Artifact artifact = 
    Artifact.createArtifact( 
      "merlin", "merlin-kernel-impl", "3.2.2" );

ClassLoader classloader = 
    m_repository.getClassLoader( artifact );</source>
