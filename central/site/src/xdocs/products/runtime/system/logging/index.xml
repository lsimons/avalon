        The Avalon Logging system is a container-side service that defines
        a framework for the logging system plugins.  The framework is 
        primarily defined by the <a href="api/index.html">Avalon Logging API</a>
        and the plugin-in model defined by the 
        <a href="../repository/index.html">Avalon Repository</a> 
        system.
        </p>
        <p>
        The avalon-logging package is a open logging platform suitable for 
        use by container implementators. It is based largely on the original
        excalibur logging system but with some important changes.  Firstly 
        it leverages the avalon-repository technology to support dynamic 
        loading of implementation strategies, secondly, it simplies the
        overall approach to target configuration, and thirdly, it applies
        a formal logging category meta-data model that is consitent with 
        avalon model-driven container solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Avalon Logging system includes as a default implementation 
        the <a href="logkit/index.html">LogKit</a> system as a plugin strategy.
        Alternative strategies include the <a href="logkit/index.html">Log4J</a> 
        implementation.
