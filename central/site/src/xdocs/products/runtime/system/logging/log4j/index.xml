    <section name="Avalon Log4J Logging Plugin">
        <p>
          The Log4J plugin for Avalon Logging allows for the usage of
          Apache Log4J log system to be driving your Avalon application.
          It is a very thin wrapper to Log4J, introducing a single extra
          method call (non reflected) for the log output methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Log4J subsystem is loaded external to the avalon/logging package,
          and how this is done for the container you use, can be found in each
          containers documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Artifact URL is; <strong><code>artifact://avalon-logging/avalon-log4j-impl#VERSION</code></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          where VERSION is the version requested version of the avalon/logging Log4J
          <strong>adapter</strong> and NOT the Log4J version.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also likely that the container will need to load the Log4J artifact
          as well. Again, this is container specific, but the Log4J artifact URL
          is; <strong><code>artifact://log4j/log4j#VERSION</code></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          where VERSION in this case identifies the Log4J version to be used.
