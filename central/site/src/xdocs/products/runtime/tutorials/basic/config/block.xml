      <subsection name="Declaring a Configuration in the Component Directive">
        <p>
        We can overwrite the default configuration behaviour by 
        including a configuration within the block.xml deployment 
        directive.
        </p>
        <p>
        Resources supporting this tutorial are contained in the 
        tutorials/configuration/block directory.

     <component name="hello" class="tutorial.HelloComponent">

        <p>
        Build and run the tutorial again.

$ maven
$ merlin -execute target\classes
</source>
        <p>
        In the logging output we see that the configuration
        supplied to the component has been overrided by the 
        information we supplied inside the &lt;component&gt;
        directive.

      <subsection name="Using Target Overrides">

        <p>
        The <a href="override.html">next tutorial</a> shows how 
        you can modify configurations via declaration of a set 
        configuration override targets.  This is usefull when 
        you have a packaged deployment scenario and you want to 
        override/suppliment the configuration with different 
        information (such as host name, username, passwords, etc.).
