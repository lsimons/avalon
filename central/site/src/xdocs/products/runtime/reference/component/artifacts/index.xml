      <subsection name="Overview">

      <p>
Component-based solutions leverage the principals of Inversersion of Control 
(IoC). This principal leads to the notion that a component should be supplied 
with the resources it needs in order to function.  Another way of looking at 
this is that the component code should not be cluttered with content that is 
attempting to resolve resources relative to its environment. Through the 
application of a meta-info model a container has available to it a complete 
description of the component type and from this information can build the 
necessary resources that a component needs. These resources are supplied to 
a component through a set of standard Avalon lifecycle artificats.  These 
include

<a href="../../../../../avalon/runtime/@RUNTIME-VERSION@/api/org/apache/avalon/framework/context/Context.html">Context</a>,

Two styles of artifact delivery are supported:

          <tr>
            <td>injection</td>
            <td>
The artifact injection strategy enables the passing of artifacts via the component constructor.  This approach minimises lines of code dealing with establishment, enables the allocation of final variables, and eliminates the requirement for explict initialization or startup phases.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>phased</td>
            <td>
The phased artifact delivery strategy is based on a set of delivery interfaces 
(<a href="../../../../../avalon/runtime/@RUNTIME-VERSION@/api/org/apache/avalon/framework/logger/LogEnabled.html">LogEnabled</a>, 
<a href="../../../../../avalon/runtime/@RUNTIME-VERSION@/api/org/apache/avalon/framework/context/Contextualizable.html">Contextualizable</a>, 
<a href="../../../../../avalon/runtime/@RUNTIME-VERSION@/api/org/apache/avalon/framework/configuration/Configurable.html">Configurable</a>, 
<a href="../../../../../avalon/runtime/@RUNTIME-VERSION@/api/org/apache/avalon/framework/parameters/Parameterizable.html">Parameterizable</a> and 
<a href="../../../../../avalon/runtime/@RUNTIME-VERSION@/api/org/apache/avalon/framework/service/Serviceable.html">Serviceable</a>).  
The advantage of phased delivery over the injection strategy relates to artifact
re-assignment by a component management subsystem. Phased artifact delivery is 
the traditional approach used in earlier Avalon solutions.
