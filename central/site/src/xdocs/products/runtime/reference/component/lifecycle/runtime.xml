    <section name="Runtime Management">

      <p>
Runtime management deals with interaction with a component between the incarnation and etherialization stages.  The Avalon framework defines the notion of a suspendable component.  The framework also defines a number of delivery interfaces dealing with reintroduction of lifecycle artificats. None of the framework reintroduction interfaces are supported - instead, runtime management is approached as a management concern wherein any existing artifact delivery interface may be reused by a container while a component is under a suspended state.  The action of resumption is equivalent to the notion of re-initialization.
      </p>

<p>
A component implementing the
<a href="../../../../../avalon/runtime/@RUNTIME-VERSION@/api/org/apache/avalon/framework/activity/Suspendable.html">Suspendable</a>
lifecycle may be suspended by a container management system. Following 
suspension a container may re-apply lifecycle artifact delivery stages 
(logging, contextualization, service, parameterization).

<p><i>Suspendable Example:</i></p>
<source>
/**
 * Suspend the component.
 */
 public void suspend()
