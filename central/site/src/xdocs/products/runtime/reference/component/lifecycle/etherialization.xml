        <p>
The etherialization stage is the component equivalent of an object finalization.  Etherialization covers the stopping of a running component and subsequent disposal.  Initiation of the etherialization phase on a component instance is exclusively controlled by it's container.
        </p>

<p>
A component implementing the the <a href="../../../../../avalon/runtime/@RUNTIME-VERSION@/api/org/apache/avalon/framework/activity/Startable.html">Startable</a> lifecycle interface will be shutdown by the container.

<p><i>Startable Example:</i></p>

/**
 * Stop the component.

 public void stop() throws Exception

<p>
A component may participate in end-of-life processing by implementing the 
<a href="../../../../../avalon/runtime/@RUNTIME-VERSION@/api/org/apache/avalon/framework/activity/Disposable.html">Disposable</a> lifecycle interface. An implementation will typically released references during this stage.
