            An absolute or relative file path that serves as the relative 
            base directory for the resolution of included entries.  If the 
            supplied value is a relative path, the path will be resolved
            relative to the <a href="../../../../../system/properties.html">
            merlin.anchor</a> system parameter. If no include directives are
            contained in the fileset specification, then the fileset behavior
            defaults to adding the directory specified by the dir attribute
            to the classpath.
