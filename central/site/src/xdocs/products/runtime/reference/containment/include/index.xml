    <section name="Include Directive">

      <subsection name="Description">
<p>An include directive instructs Merlin to load and deploy the block defined within the referenced jar file as a subcontainer within the enclosing container.  The include directive is equivalent to the nesting of a full block definition within another block.  Block includes enable composition of pre-packaged component based solutions as the included block appears to other components as a regular component (exposing services and dependecies, etc.).</p>
