      <p>
The Merlin platform is the Reference Implementation of the Avalon Component 
and Deployment contract.  This specification is presented in terms of the 
component specification (covering meta-info, container/component interaction, 
lifecycle, lifestyle, etc.) and deployment specification (component and 
container directives, classloaders, composition management etc.).  In both 
cases the specifications dealing with multiple underlying sub-systems - 
including the Avalon Meta, Composition, and Activation packages.
