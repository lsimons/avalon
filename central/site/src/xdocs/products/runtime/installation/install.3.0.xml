                <p>
                    To use Merlin command line support or the Merlin NT Service
                    you will need to define the MERLIN_HOME environment
                    variable for your system and include MERLIN_HOME/bin in
                    your system path:
                </p>

<source><![CDATA[
$ echo '
> # set location of merlin
> export MERLIN_HOME=/opt/merlin
> # include it in the path
> export PATH=$PATH:$MERLIN_HOME/bin
> ' >> ~/.bash_profile
$ source ~/.bash_profile
]]></source>

            <subsection name="Validating your installation.">

                <p>
                    The following instructions assume that you have defined the
                    MERLIN_HOME environment variable that points the directory
                    containing the Merlin installation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To confirm that you MERLIN_HOME variable is correct, you
                    should open a new command line window and invoke the Merlin
                    CLI application. The following command should list the
                    Merlin CLI help information.
                </p>
