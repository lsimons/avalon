    <p>
      Berin has helped define and document the Avalon projects since 2000.
      He has been involved in Apache Avalon and Apache Cocoon.  He is the
      author of the current thread-safe pool implementations as well as
      the DataSourceComponent.  Berin and Giacomo Pati were the architects
      of Excalibur's Component Management infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of the public view of the Apache Software Foundation, Berin
      has developed workflow based web applications as well as data
      manipulation services.  He has nine years of experience developing
      database backed applications, and eight years experience with
      technical writing.  Berin has only been developing Java since 1999,
      but his background in other Object Oriented Languages and architectures
      like C++ and CORBA helped him get a jump start.

       Paul is most interested in applications that run on top of Phoenix.  As such he constantly
       trawls the internet look for suitable server applications for Phoenix.  He tries to persuade
       the authors to rebase to Phoenix or make their apps phoenix compatible.

       Paul wrote some of blocks for Cornerstone and some of the apps in Avalon
       apps. He also started AvalonDB, <!-- removed the ref since it is no longer valid -->

     <p>
       After the departure of Paul and Berin, Niclas have taken up to be the
       standard bearer of Avalon's Mission and the vanguard of the Component
       Author.
     </p>
     <p>
       When Niclas is not working on Apache Avalon, he is busy as a
       consultant and developer in technically difficult projects. He also
       developing an Avalon-based Process Control &amp; Industrial Automation 
       framework, where component re-use can be heavily leveraged.
