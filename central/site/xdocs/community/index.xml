      These pages list many of the contributors to avalon. They
      have worked and are working long and hard to make quality
      software for the rest of the world to use.  Contributors to the
      Avalon Project should be extremely proud of themselves!  If you
      would like to become a contributor, please see the Get Involved
      document to figure out how. If you are a contributor but are not
      listed, submit a patch!

      Avalon, like all other projects at Apache, is a
      <em>meritocracy</em> and follows the <em>Apache Way</em> of
      community and project management.  This page contains a bunch of 
      references to the structure, operation and process aspects that
      help us maintain project oversight.
